The legalization of marijuana is a huge controversy. Some peoples think its a good idea and others think its bad. I think its a good idea to legalize marijuana.First, peoples should be able to do what they want with their own bodies. If they want to smoke marijuana, they should be able to do that. Its not hurting nobody else. My dad says that its like having a beer, but instead of beer, its marijuana.Second, it would help the economy. If marijuana is legal, the government could tax it and make money from it. They could use that money to help peoples who dont have ENEF food or a place to live. My teacher says that its not fair that some peoples have so much money and others dont have ENEF.Third, it would help with medicine. My grandma has cancer, and she takes marijuana to help with the pain. If its legal, more peoples could use it to help with sicknesses. My friends mom is a doctor, and she says that marijuana is a good medicine.Fourth, it would reduce crime. If peoples could buy marijuana legally, they wouldnt have to buy it from bad peoples on the street. My brother says that he knows peoples who have gotten in trouble with the law because they were caught with marijuana. If it was legal, they wouldnt have gotten in trouble.I know some peoples think that marijuana is bad for you and that its a gateway drug. But my dad says thats not true. He says that its not as bad as other drugs like heroin or cocaine. And my teacher says that we should be able to make our own choices and not have the government tell us what to do.In conclusion, I think the legalization of marijuana is a good idea. It would help peoples have more freedom, it would help the economy, it would help with medicine, and it would reduce crime. I hope that one day, marijuana will be legal and peoples can make their own choices about whether they want to use it.What do you think of their argument?
