First off I dont think there are a such thing as aliens so I dont think that would be the case. Im here to tell you guys and ladies that this is a natural landform built from rocks piled up and all around each other. If you think the aliens did it you could they have done it if its sticking outside the ground instead of inside. As you see in the pictures then the years go by the cameras and pictures get better Ashe face structure starts to disappear, and it makes it look like a bunch of rocks. They dont know if they have actually seen a face they said it UAS winter on that side then this picture UAS token. So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras then they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but i would see why you would think that. It is kind of hard to see other things like this on other planets that dont even have human life or something close to it for this to happen. You should have already known it ASNt a face then JPL web site said it ASNt and it UAS just a natural landform like all the other craters.
