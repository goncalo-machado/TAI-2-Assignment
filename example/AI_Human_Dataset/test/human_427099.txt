In the article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile.", the author discusses the idea of using Facial Action Coding Systems in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System is a software that allows computers to read expressions of faces. For example, this program was able to detect that the Mona Lisa was, "83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." (DAuto 12) This technology could have a great impact on children in school. Putting computers with Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, in order to hap read students emotions and make the lesson more appearing to them, is a good idea.The Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in classrooms. In most classrooms now, there are 2030 students and only one teacher. This is a great responsibility for a teacher to take on. With computers as hap, learning in a classroom could be much more affective. Dr Huang states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor." Many children in classrooms can fair behind without one on one time with a teacher. However, since classrooms are so big, it becomes less likely that a child who wants hap actually gets the attention they need. With computers like these in classrooms, kids who need an little extra could get the practice without a teacher.Although this technology could be life changing in many ways, it has its flaws. For example, we are stiii an long ways from being able to put these computers in every classroom. Also, the cost of this technology is unknown. This could add to extra fees families have to pay when sending their child to school, some of which may not be abide pay for this type of computer system. Even if the cost of these computers were now, and they were able to be in every classroom, would they work property AII the time? Technology is not perfect and if the Facial Action Coding System is unreliable, then are they ready worth the money?Yes, these computers are worth the money. Despite AII the possibilities that could go wrong with this technology, they stiii have great potential. Children would be getting a better education. Some students are ahead of others, and need more of a challenge. The Facial Action Coding System can hap those who seem bored in class, which gives the children the opportunity to learn more in a regular classroom setting. It also makes everyone in the classroom equal. While everyone is on the computer, it doesnt separate those who need hap from those who do. This WWII boost childrens confidence and teach them to like school more while getting a better education at the same time.There are several benefits to putting the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms in order to hap read students emotions and make the lesson more appearing. This system can hap provide more challenging material and an opportunity to learn more for the students who need it. It can also provide more hap and extra lessons for the students who are behind in class. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would hap out teachers who have big classes. It would provide more one on one time for AII students which would boost the rate they learn at, proving it is a good idea to have these types of computer systems in a classroom.
