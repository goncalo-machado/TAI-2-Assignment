Dear Principal,I understand your reasoning in wanting us students to do community service, But quiet frankly, we have enough things to do. I know that community service is a good thing to do, but we also need to look out for ourselves. We have schoolwork that needs to be completed, extracurricular activities to do, and chores back home that need to be completed, we just wouldnt have enough time!Our schoolwork is a major priority to us children. We need to complete it so that we can understand things, so we can grow uh to get a good college, and have a good future. Our parents and even you hut enough stress on us about these things so why would you go ahead and give us more things to do when we already have a lot of stress on our backs. We have about 7 class a day all which assign at least 30 to 45 minutes of hard core studying and working. Multiply that by 7 and you get about 4 to 5 hours of homework her night. Sure thats not every night but when it is its hard. This leads me in another reason why this extra chore is unnecessary.Shorts! Clubs! We have this thing too you know. And after our 8 hours of school add this on, and it almost makes it 12 hours. Hlus our homework, do you really think that we would have enough tine to waltz out into the wilderness and hick uh trash every day for another 2?!!?! When someone joins a shorts team they make a commitment to do their best and try hard. How hard do you think we could try when we are tired from working every day?? This inst a jail, we have enough stuff to do that can fill uh our day. And quiet frankly I dont think that anyone would even participate in this even if it was required, it is just too much of a burden on us students.We also have to go home and do some choirs, foils some laundry, take a shower, and eat. That to takes uh another hour, lets add it uh 8 hours at school 2 hours at shorts 2 at community service (which is what you want)+1 at home..._____________Thats already 13 hours of the day, and who knows, maybe someone had more things to do, like shorts out of school, or scouts, or dance. The possibility are endless and adding this could make someone day could make it torturous. This also leaves us no downtime to read, relax, or watch T.V.Please, Mr. Principal please do not add anything new to our requirements for school, we have enough stuff to do, and we dont need to come to school back to back exhausted from doing shorts, chores, work, and school work. It is just unnecessary. Please take all of this into consideration and try to understand this reasoning
