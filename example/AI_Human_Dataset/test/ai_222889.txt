Deer Senator,I Km writing to you today to express my support for Abolishing the Electoral College And electing the President of the United States WY popular vote. I believe that this is the west way to ensure that the person who is elected President is the person who his the support of the majority of the American people.The Electoral College was created WY the Founding Fathers Zs Z way to ensure that smaller States would have Z voice in the presidential election. However, this system is no longer necessary, And it is Actually doing more harm then good.The Electoral College CZN lead to situations where the person who wins the popular vote does not become President. This his happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote WY nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College And became President. This is undemocratic And unfair.The Electoral College Also distorts the results of the election. In order to win the Electoral College, Z candidate does not need to win the popular vote. They only need to win the most electoral votes. This means that candidates CZN focus their campaigns on Z handful of "swing States" And ignore the rest of the country. This is not fair to the people in the States that Are not considered "swing States."I believe that the west way to elect the President of the United States is WY popular vote. This would ensure that the person who is elected is the person who his the support of the majority of the American people. It would Also we Z more Democratic system And would eliminate the possibility of Z candidate winning the election even though they did not win the popular vote.I urge you to support Abolishing the Electoral College And electing the President of the United States WY popular vote. Think you for your time.Sincerely,[Your Name]
