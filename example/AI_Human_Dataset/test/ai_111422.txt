Are Senator, I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to instead elect the president by a popular national vote. While the Electoral College was devised with the aim of giving smaller states more influence, I believe it no longer adequately serves that purpose and creates disadvantages that outweigh its merits.One argument often made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on population centers. However, research shows that candidates already focus their efforts only on swing states under the current system. This means voters in dozens of noncompetitive states are essentially ignored during campaigns. Electing by popular vote could encourage candidates to campaign across the entire nation and appeal to a broader range of Americans. It is also argued that the Electoral College protects the interests of small states. But according to census data, population has dramatically shifted since the system was established, and now just a handful of states receive disproportionate attention. A popular vote would give every vote equal weight regardless of what state someone lives in. This aligns more closely with the democratic principle of one person, one vote. A further counterargument is that without the Electoral College, presidential candidates might win with just a plurality of votes rather than a majority. However, there are alternative electoral methods like ranked choice voting that could help ensure a majority is still achieved through additional rounds of counting. Overall, a national popular vote seems simpler, fairer and more consistent with Americans’ shared democratic values of equal representation.For these reasons, I believe changing to a national popular vote system would address flaws in the current Electoral College approach and better serve the interests of all citizens across states. I hope you will consider supporting reforms to move in this direction. The presidency should be determined by who Americans collectively choose as their leader.
