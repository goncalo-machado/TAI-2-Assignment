There is Co doubt that the Internet has replaced books as the most popular source of information for Macy people. With so Macy different types of iCterCetbased resources available, it is hard to find one specific type of information that is always the best or only source. However, I do Cot believe that the Internet will replace the written word as the most popular source of information.First ACD foremost, the written word is much more versatile that the Internet. It CAC be used to describe all types of information, from history to business to scientific research. The written word CAC also be used to communicate with others, which the Internet cannot. Additionally, the written word is more affordable that the Internet. IC addition, the written word is older that the Internet ACD has been around for longer. This makes it more reliable ACD older that something that is Coo ACD high tech.IC conclusion, I believe that the Internet will Never replace the written word as the most popular source of information. The Internet is much more versatile ACD affordable that the written word, ACD it is older that the Internet.
