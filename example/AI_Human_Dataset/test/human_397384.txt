The technology that is being used to show what you are actually feeling in the picture is not a such bad idea, but its also not something everyone would like to use. Many people might just not want to let know what is behind that "Fake mile" people just dont really want their own expression to hurt other peoples feelings. This is the way I can think one example, say you take a picture with a celebrity thats maybe tired or real mad but still has to take a photo with you and make a fake smile. You wouldnt even know until you get home and check on the image to see whats behind that act and whats behind the image, thats when you get upset and find out about the trust because maybe its not the moment that you wanted to capture in for that photo with a person you admire. Another example, we now know or think we know what Lisa was feeling behind that image, but nobody will eventually end up knowing the actual truth behind that. Anatomy is a great thing to know about because you are learning nearly Eva single thing about the body such as the muscles and the organs and all the small things body would have even known of before. Eventually technology could get so better as these generations change, people now know better ways of acting and making themself feel a way they might not want to feel but yet can lie to others. Not all cameras on a computer might be able to detect much from a face. What would be the point of doing all this research and finding ways to know whats behind an image. What are people now doing about the photo now that they "Know" what Mona Lisa was feeling. Will the be changes and speeches about what behind photos now? We also have to think about what other benefits could be pulled out from doing all of this new technology.If I were to one hundred percent agree to this then I would say that it would be amazing, to figure out what person is feeling because maybe you want to find out the truth about something for a serious work case. I just think that there are two ways someone could go in with this. To i would say that its a good thing and a bad thing for this new technology to come to an end or to a better start.
