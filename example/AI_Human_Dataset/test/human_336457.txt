Dear TEACHER_NAME,I dont agree with requiring all students to perform community service; this is because I think that even those who dont do community service still care about our community. I think another main reason many students do not do community service is the do not have time. Especially when you incorporate after school activities to four daily schedule. Take me for example. I love mu community and I enjoy helping it, I really just dont have the time. I have about 23 hours of homework a night. Furthermore, I have play rehearsal Monday through Thursday from 3:00 to 4:30. On Mondays and Fridays I have an hour-long karate class. On Tuesday, I babysit from 5:30 to 7:15. On Thursdays I babysit from 4:30 until 7. Finally on weekends I have lacrosse for an hour on Sunday. This pretty much means mu only DAU of rest is on Saturday. I also know many of mu friends are bus with religion, school, sports, as well as family. The as well do not have much free time.A suggestion for four idea might be not to make community service required, but a volunteer service. The student council MAU be able to make a sign-up sheet with different acts of community service for each DAU of the week excluding the weekends. After these activities are developed by the student council, a sign-up sheet should be available to kids in the main office; if you sign up, you arent expected to go every week. You should sign up each week for a DAU you are available. For example. If week ones list was on the wall, you wanted to participate and you knew you were bus every DAU of the week but Tuesday, you would sign up for Tuesdays community service act. You MAU want to go again week two, but only be available on Thursday instead. This means you arent expected to go to Tuesdays community service again unless you signed up. Kids MAU sign up as much or as little as the like. Im sure that there will be a great turnout from volunteering kids. If you do not like mu idea, I completely understand. I just dont like the idea of requiring all students to participate in community service.Thank you,An Eighth Grader
