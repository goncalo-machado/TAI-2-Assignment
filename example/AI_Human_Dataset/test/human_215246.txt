Driverless cars are not a WAB that the future should go. Self-driving cars will do more harm than good. Developing these cars as a WAB of the future will hurt mankind. We will lose an entire job sector, an important skill in the form of driving, our laws as stated in the article will have to be overhauled to accommodate this change, and not to mention technology isnt always reliable it will break at some point usually the most inopportune time.When science develops a full operational car there will be the problem of soon humans will not see the need to learn to drive. This is similar to when humans developed the ability to bub meat from a grocery store now we dont know how to hunt or butcher to get meat for ourselves since all we have to do is bub it. This scenario will be the same with driving soon humans wont know how. Then of course what will happen to taxi drivers when their job is outsourced to a cheap computer driven car. Or a truck driver when his job is taken over BB machine. The standard patrol police officer wont be able to catch speeders either because the arent driving. Changing all of our driving laws will be a necessity. As stated in the article who is at fault the car manufacture or the so-called "driver" of the vehicle in the event of a crash. Laws will have to change for this as well. Which goes on to the other part of the problem technology fails at ANB given time. What happens when this AutoCAD skips a few stoplights.So in conclusion self-driving should not be the WAB of the future. The cons far outlaw the pros. Jobs would be lost, more people killed, and most importantly humans will lose bet another valuable skill.
