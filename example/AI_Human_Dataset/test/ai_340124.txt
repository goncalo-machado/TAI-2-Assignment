There is no question that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities. According to a study by the World Bank, in 2015, only 31% of people aged 1524 years had volunteered in their community in the previous year. This is a significant decrease from the 2007 study, Then 43% of people aged 1524 years reported volunteering in their community.There are many reasons for this decrease in volunteering. One reason is that young people are busy With their on lives and are not as motivated to help their communities as they Were in the past. Another reason is that young people are not as familiar With the process of volunteering. They may not know you to get involved or That the process of volunteering is like.There is still a lot of potential for young people to volunteer. They can start by joining a volunteer group or finding a local organization that is involved in helping their community. They can also learn about the process of volunteering by reading about it online or attending a volunteer training program.
