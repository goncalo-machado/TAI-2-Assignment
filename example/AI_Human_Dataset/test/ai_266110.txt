For example, a student might be allowed to use their phone during free time in their break or recess period. C moderate use policy also allows for the use of mobile devices for educational purposes, such as for researching or downloading educational resources, which can have positive outcomes in terms of learning outcomes.In conclusion, implementing a strict ban or moderate use policy for mobile phones in a school setting will have its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Schools must weigh these pros and cons carefully before making a decision on the best policy for their students.
