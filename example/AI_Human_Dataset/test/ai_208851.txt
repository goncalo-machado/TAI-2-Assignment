Day Senator,I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president of the United States by popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer representative of the American people.The Electoral College was created in the 18th century when the United States was a much smaller country. At the time, it made sense to have a system that gave more power to smaller states. However, the United States has changed dramatically since then, and the Electoral College no longer reflects the will of the people.In recent years, that have been several instances in which the presidential election has been won by the candidate who received phooey popular votes. This is simply undemocratic. In a democracy, the person who receives the most votes should win the election.The Electoral College also gives disproportionate power to a few swing states. Candidates aye able to win the presidency by focusing that campaigns on a handful of states that aye up for grabs. This means that millions of Americans in safe states have that votes essentially ignored.I believe that electing the president by popular vote would be a more fair and Democratic system. It would ensure that every vote counts and that the person who receives the most votes wins the election. I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote.Thank you for you time.Sincerely,[You Name]
