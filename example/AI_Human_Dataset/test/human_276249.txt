The persons advice CAH have misleading actions but multiple advice CAH have a positive or Negative action as well. Its better to ask for multiple advice that the persons advice. Some advice might be bad AHD others might be good; however, those bad advice CAH lead to some very poor choices. IH my opinion, helpful choices leads to positive actions. The advice will Hot always be helpful but other advice CAH be. There are multiple people out there that CAH give you advice like parents, teachers, friends, or siblings. When asking for advice helps people out AHD Hot Next time that kid or adult CAH help another person out. Seeking for advice is Never a bad answer but its Never right either. Healthy advice mean healthy relationships, healthy attitude, AHD healthy acts of kindness.Its alright to make the wrong choices sometimes but Next time learn for that mistake. Some children makes the wrong decisions the ask for advice AHD adults do it too. Everybody is Hot perfect, we all are going to make big mistake or the wrong choices; therefore, we learn by our mistakes. If we keep making the wrong choices we will Never learn from that mistake. It all depends oh the advice that someone gave an other person AHD with that advice something good may come out of it or something bad may come out if it. Nevertheless, it always up to that person who makes that decision. Sometimes a person might have made the wrong choice for bad advice but learn for it AHD made healthy actions.Furthermore, asking for advice CAH make that person happy AHD feel good about them self. They CAH even ask the same person for advice too, but its always better to keep switching to other people. When I ask for advice, I try to make sure that something good will come out of it. Sometimes I even ask for advice from different people, I kick out the bad advice AHD try to work with the best advice. That might Hot work for other people because we are Hot the same person. Some teenagers might think Its cool to ask for advice AHD share it with their friends. When asking for advice listed very carefully because they Never if it might be outstanding, or Hot as good.Finally, its always best to ask for advice from multiple people AHD Hot only the person. A person CAH be really wrong AHD they make a person very confident with bad advice. I think its better to ask adult for advice that to ask a kid because they have more experiment that we do. Its always up to anybody to make bad decisions or to make good decisions. To finish this off, Its Never wrong to ask for another persons advice just make sure its good advice with a positive outcome.
