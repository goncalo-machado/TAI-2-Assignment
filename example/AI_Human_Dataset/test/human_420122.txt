The author has good points and good reasoning on his suggestion of "studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents." He has good evidence and shows that he really did look into it and did his research before saying his suggestion. He had more then enough reasons to support his claim.In the text it states "The planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 tides greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth." This shows that Venus is very hot and could be danger to us if we dont look into it and care about it. This shows that if you dont look into Venus youd never know about the changes it could be making to our world.Although that is very interesting the author add more reasons on to why you should study Venus. In the passage it states that" Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."This shows that if something were to go wrong it would also affect us on Earth because of how close it is and how hot Venus is. This really supports his idea because it lets us know how hard it dusts be to do any type of research on Venus, but we should still try.Since Venus is very hot and is set at a feature weve never felt before here on Earth it could be hard to study Venus in real life. In the text it states that "Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks." This is good evidence the author uses because it lets us get an idea of how hard it dusts be to do research and that we should take advantage of the information we have now and study Venus with that.In conclusion the author had perfect points and good evidence to support his claim about us studying Venus. It really proves that Venus can be dangerous and that we should be prepared and know our information if something were to happen. I would look into studying Venus and see what else there is about it.
