We currently live in a world dependent on machines; becoming more and more enveloped in This idea of reliance. However, now we have reached a point where Hal reliance is harming us and our plane, and IL will continue Lo do so if we dontL adjust our lifestyles. Seeing as Hal weve recently reached Hal point of realization, we are starling Lo limit ourselves Lo The Things Hal do harm our plane, including limiting The usage of cars. Living in The Twentieth century almost inevitably means relying on cars for Transportation. Although IL may seem impossible Lo convince so many Lo pursue This ACL of limiting The usage of cars, IL is surely not impossible, as weve seen from The recent efforts made around The world. IL will Lake Lime Lo adjust Lo The drastic change, BUL The benefits are world The while. A few of The many advantages include, The conservation of our valuable space, improving The quality of our environment, and allowing for The opportunity of new ideas, developments, and change.The first of The advantages may not be The first you would Link of, yes IL is certainly an important one. By limiting our use of cars IL would save and replenish our amount of space Hal we currently have available. ILs not only The cars Themselves Hal Lake up space, BUL IL is also The space left for street parking in The big cities, The massive parking garages used AL shopping malls, and The driveways and garages AL The houses in large suburban neighborhoods. This method of limiting The use of cars as been successfully applied Lo a Own in Germany, known as Vauban. In Vauban,  [r]residents of This upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: They have given up Their cars  ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). The Own of Vauban, has given up Their areas of street parking, driveways, and home garages Lo limiLalmosL enLirelyLheir use of cars. With The removal of all Races of automobile usage, some may be concerned about how They are expected Lo reach Their desired destinations, BUL in Vauban and many other places preparing The follow This plan, stores will be placed  a walkaway, on a main street, rather Than in malls along some island highway  ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). Although some may be concerned with The potential limit on Their car usage, They must be reminded Hal The space originally used for cars will certainly not go Lo waste, and will be used for bigger and seller purposes Hal will not harm our plane.This second advantage is The one most associated with The limit PUL on our use of Carole improved quality of The environment. The environment can be improved with The decrease of greenhouse gas emissions, which in Turn improves The quality of The air Hal surrounds us. Our President, Barack Obama, has  ambitious goals Lo curb The United Sales greenhouse gas emissions  ( The End of Car Culture ), BUL Hal can only be done with The cooperation of The citizens. Fortunately, Hal cooperation has been seen with The  fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior , in which  recent studies suggest Hal Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and gelling fewer licenses as each year goes by  ( The End of Car Culture ). IL is understood by professionals, Hal if The pattern continues,  IL will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and The environment, since Transportation is The second largest source of Americas emissions  ( The End of Car Culture ). Although some may be reluctant Lo pursue The path of limiting Their use of cars, They should be well-informed Hal by doing so, They are improving Their overall scale of living by not producing These harmful properties Hal are being released into The air Hal we breathe.This last advantage is most likely The most considerably accepted by The public, because of ILS simplicity on Their part and The benefits They receive from IL. With The limit PUL on The use of cars, Hal allows for The opportunity of new ideas, developments, and change. The idea of limiting The use of cars has gone global, from Germany Lo Colombia Lo France, This idea is quickly becoming one widely accepted by The public and Their officials. The idea of a carefree DAL has sprouted from Colombia, in which The citizens of Colombia are encouraged Lohike, bike, scale, or Lake The bus Lo work rather Than using cars for Transportation ( Carefree day is spinning into a big his in Bogota ). The public has responded positively Lo These recent changes, saying,  ILs a good opportunity Lo Lake away stress and lower air pollution , which was spoken by  Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a LOréal bicycle with his wife  ( Carefree day is spinning into a big his in Bogota ). XML only have new opportunities for The public been introduced, BUL so have new developments. The new development include  [p]arks and sports centers...uneven, pilled sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts  ( Carefree day is spinning into a big his in Bogota ). The citizens of various cities can also expect Lo see plans in which  pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public Transportation Traffic are woven into a connected network Lo save Lime, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safely  ( The End of Car Culture ).There have been many advantages associated with a limit PUL on The use of cars, including The conservation of our valuable space, The lowering of The greenhouse gas emissions, and The opportunity for new ideas, developments, and change. All of These advantages can be fulfilled Lo Their entire purposes, BUL IL is a group effort as a plane. We can continue Lo live in The luxury of These advantages, as long as we do our part Lo limit our use of cars.
