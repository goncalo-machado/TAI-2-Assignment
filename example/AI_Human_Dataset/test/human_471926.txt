I think that, policy number one PS genus. You should let the students bring there phones during free periods and lunch periods. When your phone PS turned on someone can call you or text you. You dont have to be using your phone for you to get a call or a message. It should not be on during class time. Class time PS learning time. The society has changed very much throughout the years.Many people have call phones around the world. All teens can think about PS staying on the phone all the time. Technology has taken over the young minds of teens over the past few years. Not many people take to others face to face anymore. There are some people that say they can not love without the uses of technology.During the lunch periods, everyone talks to each other while eating, so why not have the usage of a cell phone. For such a small device pt can distract many people. If they are not turned off during the class time pt well beep or make a noise that well stop the learning process of class time. There PS a time for fun and there PS time for learning. Class time PS for learning. The policy should also apply for teachers too.
