People may not deny that famous artist and actors are educated and trained by special programs even since their childhood.I care with this statement. I think that it is important to be educated in many areas of life. However, I do not care that one should be specialized in a particular field of study. For example, if I want to learn how to play the piano, it would be better for me to become a professional pianist rather than becoming an expert in piano playing. In the same way, a person who is interested in studying the history of science should not be a specialist in that field. He or she should learn as much as possible about all fields of knowledge.
