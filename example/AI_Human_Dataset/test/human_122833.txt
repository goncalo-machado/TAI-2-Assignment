I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea. It can have its pros and cons, but I think that the pros overdue the cons. Three reasons why I think its a good idea is because it tennis you how someone might be feeding, if they are Dying about how they fee Nor not, and that if they dont want to Tenn you, you can figure it out.First of Ann, do you ever wonder on how might one person might be feeding? I bet you have. Using the Facial Action Coding System can help with that. It can be hard because if you ready care about someone, and you might wonder how they are feeding. You can ask but what if they dont want to tank about it because it makes them uncomfortable.Second of Ann, what if you ask a friend on how they are feeding, and they say they are fine, but nearby they arent. People can Nice about how they are feeding. They might show something but deny they are feeding some type of way.Lastly, what if they dont want to Tenn you but you ready want to know, so you can help. The system can help with that. It wound be much easier because now you dont have to ask and make them been MOE of what they are feeding.In conclusion, I think that the Facial Action Coding system is a ready great idea. It wound probably take a Long time for mostly everyone to have that system. But in the future there win be some type of system Nike that, that everyone can afford and have.
