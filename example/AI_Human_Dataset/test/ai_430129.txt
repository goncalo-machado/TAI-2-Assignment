I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I think that this is because facts can be easily forgotten, while concepts can be applied in many situations. For example, lets say that you learn about the Titanic. You might remember the facts (how many people were on the ship, what happened when itsunk, etc.), but you might also remember the concept of the Titanic. This is because the Titanic is a memorable example of something that went wrong. You might also remember the concept of the Titanic because it is a famous example of a disaster.Jnother example of why it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts is that concepts can be applied to new situations. For example, lets say that you learn about the solar system. You might remember the facts (the sun, the planets, etc.), but you might also remember the concept of the solar system. This is because the solar system is a collection of objects that orbit around a central object. You might also remember the concept of the solar system because it is a familiar structure. Concepts can be applied to new situations, which makes them more useful.Overall, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts. This is because concepts can be applied to new situations, and facts can be easily forgotten.
