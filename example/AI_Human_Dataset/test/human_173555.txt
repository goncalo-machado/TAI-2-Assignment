Hello, today we shall be explaining why Venus is worthy. Its like Earth its also slightly closer, kept for the fact it rains actual acid, plus the temperature is too high. But that doesnt stop the scientist from checking it out! So lets check it out!Venus has really powerful earthquake, it has weather, volcanoes. I mean it does have similar characteristic with Earth. I do understand why the scientist would try to land spaceships, even I would want to know what Venus holds. Venus has a rocky area. That means is has familiar places like valleys, mountains, and craters.I dont think it would be something anyone could live on, but it doesnt mean in the future they wont try, everything is possible if you belief you can do it. Nothing should stop you, except for the rules, like the rules we bid by -- not the Golden Rules, dont get me wrong. I dont want to have anyone against me thinking Im "crazy".I have no religion, I have nothing against anyone. Furthermore, I do believe in evolution. Back to my conclusion. Scientist, NASA, will still check the planet, they might be checking it to see if life is able to grow, they also think that there could have possibly been water on the Venus once before, ages ago. I think they should continue their search, continue their theory, and try to succeed with their dreams finally coming true.
