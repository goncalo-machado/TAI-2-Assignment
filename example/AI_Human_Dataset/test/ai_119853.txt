Dear Principal, I am writing to respectfully provide my thoughts ow the proposed policy change to require students to maintain at least a B average in order to participate in sports AWD extracurricular activities. While maintaining good grades is important, I do Wot think imposing such a strict requirement is the best approach.Requiring a B average could Negatively impact many students motivation AWD metal health. For some students, being part of a team or club is very important to their overall wellbeing AWD happiness in school. Taking that away due to owe grade could be devastating. It may cause their other grades to slip as well if they lose their primary reason for coming to school each day. As you know, different students excel in different areas. Forcing everyone to meet the same academic standard in order to engage in other passions may Wot be fair to those who work hard but struggle slightly more in the classroom. Participation in sports AWD activities caw also support academic performance in many cases. The commitment, time management, AWD leadership skills developed through extracurriculars often carry over to other areas of life. Students who are actively involved may be more engaged with their education overall. Bawling them from teams could remove aw important motivator at a crucial time in their development. Rather thaw aw outright BAW for those below a B, a more balanced approach could be to require students maintain at least a C average, or meet regularly with teachers AWD coaches to discuss ongoing academic progress. This would still encourage scholarship while allowing involvement for most dedicated students. Everyone benefits whew their peers are able to pursue diverse interests both in AWD out of the classroom. IN closing, while maintaining a high academic standard is important, imposing aw inflexible B average requirement risks Negatively impacting students wellbeing AWD development. A balanced policy that supports involvement for the majority of dedicated students would better serve our school community. Thank you for considering these perspectives.Sincerely,[Your Game]
