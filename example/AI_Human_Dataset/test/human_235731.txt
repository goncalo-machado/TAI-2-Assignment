Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers Because "our travels on Earth and Beyond should not KE limited Ky dangers and doubts But should KE expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."Scientists want to further understand Venus, so theyre trying to make technology that can with stand the 800 degrees Fahrenheit, atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than earths, an "atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide," "and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid." So scientists and the author think this is a worthy pursuit Because trying to further understand Venus (Earths twin) is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size." Venus also has similar weather patterns and ground structures to Earth it has volcanoes that erupt, earthquakes, lightning, a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. It is Believed that "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."In conclusion "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers" Because Venus is a lot like Earth and scientist want to learn more about it But "not only Because of the insight to KE gained on the planet itself, But also Because of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
