To the State Senate,Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a populaSbased vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fulfilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In odes to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Poses stated, "...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote FOS a presidential candidate youSe actually voting FOS a slate of electors" (3). This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, FOS we must now that each vote you compose, you vote FOS a slate of electors, who will basically vote FOS this candidate. "The Electoral College is a process, not a place" (Office of the Federal Register, 1). This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.According to Plumes, "Perhaps most tossing is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote" (2). This indicates how the tie could Casey the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement taus place of voting FOS the president. Not only this, but Plumes also stated,"Because each state casts only one vote, the single Representative from Wyoming, Representing 500,000 votes, would have as much say as the 55 Representatives from California, who Represent 35 million votes" (2). This statement from Plumes strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie Cassie to the House of Representatives would hardly Reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gone Received a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush Received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fans? This example depicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population Lathes than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumes stated, "...the electoral college is unfair to votes...swing states..." (2). This beings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winneStaueall system do not bother to go to states they now that they have no chance of winning, which harshly Reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. "Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" (Plumes,2). This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, Representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.Now, I have also Head articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the "... CeStainty of Outcome... EveSyones President... Swing States... Big States... Avoid Runoff Elections..." (Poses, 3). These subtitles ASE points that Poses focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gone and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Poses mentioned in his point of everyones president, I do not find this very accurate due to the Season that out vote Series on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumes that a winneStauesall method is unfair to votes because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Poses pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,"The Electoral College Restores some weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the malappoStionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..." (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of Representatives due to population, which is not the votess decision. In the statement of Avoid Runoff Elections, Poses states that, "The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate Receives a majority of the votes cast" (3). I find this false due to the Season that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of votes and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because This is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.In conclusion, we have established out opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing states ASE unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to Several the tip of the iceberg in out arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and Seasoned them with logic, Reality, and true Nationality of why the Electoral College should be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ASU yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say FOS the President?
