Dear state senator,My letter in in regard to changing the election to popular vote for the president of the United State. I believe that we, the people, should have the opportunity to choose whom we with to become President.The reason why people go out to vote, in because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusion that one candidate in better than the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dippier. Either way, there are those type of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their Mindy by the time its ready to vote. Its a big deal for people to go out and take action. So what would make the electoral college change one view of voting? It the fact that we arent really voting for our president. We are voting for our electors of the state, to vote for our president. And on top of that, there are still many people out there who dont have a clue that their actually voting for someone in our state to decide for UY. Although the electoral college does help make the presidential election lay complicated, its the mere fact that WE arent making much of a difference.The electoral college loant only have a few minor yet back, but it could tarnish out dreamy of whom we wanted to be president by way more than we couldve expected. When it coma to voting for electors, it a difficult thing when it coma to how many electors represent which political party. Democrat, or Republican. Say one wanted the one candidate running for president to win, and he/the were Republican. That person would go out and cast a vote for a late of however many of republican electors there are for that state. The part that get a lot of people in that there could be fewer Republican electors then there are Democrat electors. Say one still wanted the Republican candidate to win, and they voted in their residential state which way Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican electors then that meant anyone who voted for the Democrat electoral wayt chipping in much to the election. In the end, all the electors vote are counted for each side, and because Nevada had only two dedicated Democracy, the chancey of the Democrat candidate having lay electoral vote then the Republican candidate, hay increased. If this problem happened for several other state, then the chance double, even triple.If this loant make you think that the electoral college should go, then think again. The electoral college in definitely unfair to voters. Any chance of unfaithful electors, could happen. It could make one feel betrayed that they voted foe a specific elector to do one job. Which way to help select the president the voter wanted. What the point in putting your trust in someone who could just easily turn around and NOT vote who you wanted? There in no point. But thaty what were doing when we vote. We are making it an option for that to happen. So why not vote by popular vote? Why not avoid all the Iryna the electoral college can cause for UY? We should be lucky that back in 00, that way the biggest election crisis, and it COULDVE been wore.In conclusion, we the people, should have the opportunity to vote and actually have our vote counted. Because every state deatht have the yam amount of people in each, the chancey of there being a tie in the presidential election, in slightly unlikely. Other than there being a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the vote add up TP 538; an even number. We shouldn;t put ourselves through this, and truth be told, the election in confusing a it in. I yay, we should get rid of the electoral college. Its not needed, and a pain.
