 As citizens of our community, we must consider the impact of our daily activities on the environment and our health. One of the most significant contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions is the use of cars. Therefore, it is essential to limit car usage and explore alternative transportation options.Cars are a significant source of air pollution, particularly in urban areas. According to the passage, "Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions" (Duffer). As a result, cities like Paris and Beijing have experienced severe smog, which can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. Moreover, cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a primary cause of climate change. As the passage states, "Transportation is the second-largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants" (Rosenthal).However, some people may argue that cars provide convenience and flexibility. They may claim that public transportation is unreliable, or that car ownership is necessary for daily life. Nevertheless, there are alternative transportation options that can provide similar convenience without the negative environmental impact. For instance, car sharing programs and bike sharing programs can provide flexible transportation options without the need for personal car ownership. Moreover, many cities are investing in public transportation systems, making it easier and more convenient to use.The passage also suggests that there is a shift towards alternative transportation options. According to the passage, "The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter" (Rosenthal). This trend is likely to continue as millennials, who are more inclined towards environmentally friendly transportation options, enter the workforce.Kn conclusion, limiting car usage is essential for improving air quality, reducing greenhouse
