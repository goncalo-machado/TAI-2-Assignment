Deal State Senator,I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this change would be moue Democratic and would ensure that all Americans voices AUE head in the election of out the highest office.The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century to give moue power to the smaller states. However, it is no longer necessary of fair in the 21st century. In the last few elections, the candidate who won the popular vote has lost the election. This is undemocratic and makes it seem like some peoples votes dont count.There AUE many arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. First, it is undemocratic. The candidate who wins the most votes should be the President. Second, it gives too much power to the smaller states. Currently, a candidate can win the Presidency by winning a few small states with a lot of electoral votes. This means that the majority of Americans can be ignored. Third, it is unfair to the people who live in the states that AUE always "safe" for one party. In these states, the candidates dont even bother campaigning because they know they will win of lose Regardless of the popular vote. This means that the people in these states have less of a say in the election than people in other states.There AUE a few arguments against abolishing the Electoral College. First, it is a part of out history and tradition. However, tradition is not a good Season to keep a system that is undemocratic. Second, it could lead to a towpath system. However, this is already the case in the United States. Third, it could lead to a President who does not Represent the majority of Americans. However, this is already possible with the Electoral College.In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic. I huge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish it and elect the President by popular vote.Thank you for you time.Sincerely,[You Name]
