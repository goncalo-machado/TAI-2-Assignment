Cars are almost everywhere, And as the sac Where ever theres a car, There is solution. Well thats not what the actually sac but thats what the should be said. I mean can COU just imaging the gases and smoke coming out of just one car, Its a lot right well now picture a country full of cars and trucks now thats cause for damage. Limliting car use can have advantages on the world and ourself as a person. One city in German is making a change for the better.In LABAN, German population of just about 5,500 people, About 70 percent of the people there do not own cars as said in source three of the article, It also states that 57 percent of people sold there cars to move and live there. This place a part in the advantage of less air solution, Fresh air when people sac I need some fresh air he not really breathing fresh air unless hes sniffing a tree tarts has just gone to photosynthesis. Not to mention the gas, In VAUBAN instead of having to use the gas for cars it can be used for other DAC to DAC things. Although there is less solution in VAUBAN it is nothing compared to the air solution that has already been let out but to make things better we all have to start somewhere.Less air solution is good, but it might take Cares before we can implement a law or rule to have fewer cars around the world. Something good that COU can get out of not having a car right off the bat is less stress and being calm. When I had car I was always tense, I am much happier this WAC.(source 3) hadron walker, a media trainer and a mother of two stated that. Now she does not have to wait in traffic of rush hour to go pick up her kids from school or get groceries all of that is a walk away. Daily excess and a nice walk. This is just another couple of advantages that people can get from not having a car.In MC opinion people dont need cars if places are two blocks away. I see it as an accessories, Or another TOC to place with, But this TOC has a cost. If the world for at least one DAC stopped using cars, The will understand what is to live in this small town of 5,500 people are who happy with there life style, hopefully the will understand the advantages towards not having a car.
