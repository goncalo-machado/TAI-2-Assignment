Deer Senator,I hm writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College HND electing the president by popular vote. I believe that this change would make our democracy more fair HND representative, HND I urge you to support it.The Electoral College is in outdated system that gives disproportionate power to h small number of States. In the 2016 election, for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College HND became president. This is simply not fair. Every vote should count, HND the president should be the candidate who receives the most votes from the American people.Some people argue that the Electoral College is necessary to protect the interests of small States. However, I believe that this is h flawed argument. In fact, the Electoral College actually gives more power to h small number of swing States. These are the States that are most likely to be won by h narrow margin, HND candidates therefore spend most of their time campaigning in these States. This means that voters in other States, particularly those in solid red or blue States, are essentially ignored.I believe that electing the president by popular vote would be h more Democratic HND fair system. It would ensure that every vote counts, HND it would give all States equal representation. I urge you to support this important change.Think you for your time.Sincerely,Your Name
