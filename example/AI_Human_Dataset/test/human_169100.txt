A Seagoing Cowboy is someone who helped take animals to the countries that were devastated by World War ll.I, Luke Merger, am a Seagoing Cowboy.I not only got to help others who were in need, but I also got to experience the sights and historic landmarks in other countries.Furthermore, I highly encourage you to join the UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and be a Seagoing Cowboy.Think of how sad you would be if you were devastated by the war and had barely anything left.Wouldnt you want someone to help bring you supplies such as animals?Well you can be one of the few people to contribute.The families overseas are all very kind and appreciative.Though they are still very much in need.So, you would just be helping the cause by joining.Over the past year, me and my friend, Don Last, have had the opportunity to see historical landmarks.The chance to just see Europe and China would have been special.But Don and I got to experience so much more than that.We got to see the Acropolis in Greece.Also, taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, was a treat.I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.Come on.Dont tell me you wouldnt love to have the opportunity to see the Panama Canal!All you have to do is join the Seagoing Cowboys.As you can clearly tell, being a Seagoing Cowboy is truly a great experience.We get to help those in need, and also have the chance to see historic landmarks around the world.I hope that soon, you will decide to be like Don and me and join the UNRWA and become a Seagoing Cowboy.
