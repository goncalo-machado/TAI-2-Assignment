Okay, heres my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grace student:Hey, guys! Today were gonna talk about this thing where schools want us to pick our career by the time were in high school. Like, I get it, its cool to have a plan an call, but I think its kinda stressful. I mean, what if we change our mines like, a million times? Or what if were just not sure what we want to co yet? Its like, shouldnt we be allowed to explore ANC figure it out at our own pace?So, I CIC some research ANC found out that some people who took nontraditional paths after high school once up being super successful. Like, CIC you know that Mark Zuckerberg CICt even finish college? ANC hes like, a billionaire or something! Or that J.K. Rowling was a single mom on welfare before she became a bestselling author. Like, whoa. So, maybe its not such a BAC thing to take a little time to figure things out.But, on the other hand, some people say that picking a career by high school can help us get into college ANC stuff. An cits like, I get that, but shouldnt we be allowed to explore our interests ANC passions first? I mean, what if were good at something thats not even on the career lancer? Like, what if Im really good at playing video games ANC I want to be a pro gamer? Should I just give up on that because its not a "real" career?I cont know, guys. Im just not sure what to think. But, I co know that I cont want to be forces into something that Im not sure about. Cant we just take a keep breath ANC figure it out together? Like, as a society or something?So, thats my essay. I hope you guys like cit. Let me know what you think!
