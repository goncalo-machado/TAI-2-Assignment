When it comes to learning English, many people believe that both reading and speaking are equally important. However, I believe that speaking is more important for Chinese learners.There are a few reasons for this. First, Chinese learners have to learn how to contract sentences in English. This means that they need to be able to Understand and produce complete sentences. This is Mach harder to do if they only focus on reading.Second, Chinese learners need to be able to ASE English in a variety of situations. This includes speaking with friends, Using the internet, and speaking in professional settings. If they only focus on reading, they may not be able to do these things as well.Finally, Chinese learners need to be able to ASE English in a variety of contexts. This includes reading English texts, listening to English radio, and watching English videos. If they only focus on speaking, they may not be able to do these things as well.All of these reasons make speaking more important for Chinese learners.
