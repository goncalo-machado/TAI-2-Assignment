 Grades for extracurricular activities.Grades for extracurricular activities are an issue that has been debated for many years. There are those who believe that grades should be given for participation, while others believe that grades should be based on performance. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and offer my opinion on the matter.Some people argue that participants in extracurricular activities should be given grades based on participation alone. They believe that it is important to encourage children to become active in their communities and that grades can be used as an incentive. In addition, they argue that not all extracurricular activities require a significant level of performance, and that it would be unfair to expect a certain level of skill or talent from all participants.On the other hand, others argue that grades for extracurricular activities should be based on performance, rather than participation. They believe that grades play an important role in motivating students to strive for excellence and that it is only fair to expect a certain level of performance from those who participate in these activities. For example, if a student is involved in a school sports team, they should be expected to perform at a certain level in order to receive a letter grade.In my opinion, grades for extracurricular activities should be based on a combination of both participation and performance. There are many extracurricular activities that involve a significant amount of skill or talent, and it would be unfair to not expect a certain level of performance from these students. At the same time, it is important to encourage students to become active in their communities, and participation should be taken into account when awarding grades for these activities.To implement this system, grades for extracurricular activities should be broken down into two categories: participation and performance. For example, a student who participates in a school sports team could receive a letter grade based on their attendance and participation at practices and games. However, they could also receive additional points or bonuses based on their performance on the field or in other areas of the game (such as scoring goals).In conclusion, grades for extracurricular activities are an important issue that must be considered carefully. While grades can be an effective motivator for students to strive for excellence, it is important to recognize that not all extracurricular activities require the same level of performance. A grade for participation should be given to any student who actively participates in an extracurricular activity, while grades for performance should be given based on the level of skill or talent required for the activity. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a system that balances participation and performance in a way that encourages students to become active in their communities while demanding excellence in these activities.
