Cars use a lot of gas and make the world polluted. There are communities that have given up their cars and are sticking to walking and riding bikes. There is a town in Germany called Vauban that make you pay $40,000 with your house if you want to have a parking space. Also in this town there are only two places to park and this means that 70% of the population there down own cars and 57% sold their cars to live there. People in this town say that living there with no cars relieves stress.In the city of Paris after days of pollution they made a ban on driving to fix the smog.On Mondays motorist that had even number license plates were told not to drive or face a $31 dollar fine. On the next day odd number license plate couldnt drive. 4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars impounded do to their reaction to the fine. There were a couple exceptions like plug-in cars, hybrids, also cars carrying more than three people, but they make pubic transit free from Monday to Friday.These acts are happening in countries like Colombia. In Bogotá, Colombia they celebrate their third year when cars have been banned with the only motor transportation being buses and taxis. They call this day "The day without cars" in the capital city which has about 7million people. They are doing this to promote other mean of transportation and violators ADN fined $25. A lot of people like to participate in this because it lowers air pollution and stress. Because of this day this city has made 118 miles of bike paths.In America scientist have found that people 16- to -39 years old are not getting their license. With this drop scientist think that pollution will go down in America. In 2005 the number of miles was at its peak and dropped steadily after that. In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% below the peak and is even with the amount in 1995. All of these are ways to cut down on not only pollution but also stress.
