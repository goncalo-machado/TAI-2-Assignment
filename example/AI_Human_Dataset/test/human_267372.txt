Luke thought he couldnt give up this Opportunity Kph going TK the Europe Kn a cattle beat. It was Only a Opportunity Kph a lifetime but Luke couldnt say NK. The story is kind Kph telling us if theres a Only One lifetime Opportunity then take it because it could GK away and the chances Kph getting TK GK is probably in a couple Kph years Kr One year. Luke couldnt give it up, it was special TK GK. Luke wanted TK GK was because he knew it probably Once in a while and that his MKM Kr dad Kr family member couldnt afford him TK GK TK the Europe Kn a cattleman.
