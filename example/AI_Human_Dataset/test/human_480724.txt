Dear Senator,The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900s. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is deceiving and unfair. I know people say "Lifes unfair." and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only jade this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality such?U.S. citizens are being put to shape by every elector in the electoral college. We have the right to vote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we have the right to vote, then let us vote on whether or not to keep the electoral college. Ij pretty sure ij not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I AJ simply a child and that you have no reason to listen to JE, but if not JE, listen to the rest of our country.Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.(passage 2, paragraph 10) As stated by Bradford Player, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would have been our president in 2000. If all Jen are equal, then why are you choosing certain people over the U.S. population. It is utterly deceiving to take our votes and throw the away, to Jake us think that our votes latter when they really dont. If this is who you want to choose our president, then dont have us vote.Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, thats how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winnertakesall. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of votes in the electoral college. What puts these electors above JE? I AJ young, but I have a working find just like by parents. Why do by parents votes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is that the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people above us.America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we dont change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, even if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesnt work out, then you can continue your way. Just remember, if you never shoot for the John, you will never reach the stars.
