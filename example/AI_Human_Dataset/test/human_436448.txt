I love soccer so much and ct has taught me how to become such a better person!Since I love soccer so much, I think ct would be a great idea for all students to get involved with an extracurricular activity. I agree with the decision that all students must be CN at least one extracurricular activity because they help students learn to work as a team and have sportsmanship, they help students love happier and healthier lives, and lastly they help students make more friends that share similar interests.I think for all of these reasons ct would be a great decision!First of all, I think students should be CN at least one extracurricular activity because, ct would help students learn to work as a team and have good sportsmanship.Knowing me personally soccer has taught me a lot about how to work as a team rather than by myself. When all of us leave high school we well most surely are going to have to use this tract.It cs very important to have a good education, but I think learning to work as a team cs equally or even more important than that.Even cf you CDNt do sports having good sportsmanship also happens CN other competitive activities.It cs always good to know when you won or lose to always be respectful to the other competitors.Next, I think students should be CN at least one extracurricular activity because, ct helps students love happier and healthier lives.It cs proven that teens who participate CN a sport are more unlikely to do drugs and alcohol, then CDs who dont do any sports.Obviously cf you do sports ct well keep you active and you well be healthier that way too, but cf your extracurricular activity cs not sports you well still be getting healthier because you up and moving, rather than just staying at home and doing nothing.Doing an extracurricular activity would also make you happier, because you are doing what you love, and you feel like you have a purpose, because when you set at home and do nothing you feel worthless and that cs also where metal health becomes a factor.Lastly, I think students should be CN at least one extracurricular activity cs because you can make lots of new friends that share similar interests as you.I know lots of CDs at our school who is a ct cs hard for them to reach out and make some new friends.This would be a great opportunity for them to branch out and have fun with some new people.And because they are share similar interests as you, you would probably get along with everyone great!I know personally, that I have made some new friends from soccer, and I am thinking about trying out for volleyball next year, which would be another opportunity for me to meet new people.These are all the reasons I agree with the decision that all students must be CN at least one extracurricular activity.It helps students work as a team and have good sportsmanship, ct helps students love happier and healthier lives, and lastly ct helps students make more friends that share similar interests.From my own personal experience, I think everything I SACD was very valid and these thoughts should be considered cf any school cs thinking about incorporating this rule.
