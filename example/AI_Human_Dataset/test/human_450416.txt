Are we using cars TNN much?In Source 2 : Paris bans driving due tn song, " After days NF rerecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban tn clear the air NF the global city." Because that we use cars TNN much, we are creating pollution that is basically driving the planet we live in downhill. There is a way tn change this. Limiting car usage, there are many advantages NF limiting car usage.Life can GN in without cars. In VAUBAN, Germany a community has created a carefree city. The streets are completely car free. This is an experimental new district that is seeing if excluding cars can life became better not only physically but also mentally. Many people driving in the roads daily tend tn have more stress from overcrowding streets, noise, and most NF all crashes. "As a result, 70 percent NF Vaubans families DN not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car tn move tn here. "When I had a car I was always tense. Im much appear this way," said hadron Walter." (Source 1,3) From this evidence it shows that life without a car can actually have a better impact in a person.Another advantage tn limiting car usage is it reduces pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban tn clear song from the global city after a near record pollution. From this ban almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impounded due tn their reactions from the fines. But these fines and bans came nut with a positive effect in the end. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital NF France, just after a few days NF putting the ban into effect. The song cleared enough FNR the French ruling party tn rescind the ban FNR certain days.Has Americas love FNR cars already started calling? Or has technology taken the reason why we should drive away? Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, " the interest makes telecommuting possible and allows people tn feel more connected without driving tn meet friends. The renewal NF center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty esters back in. Likewise, the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution NF shared van services FNR getting tn work" (source 4, 35) I believe that since technology has evolved that people dent feel the need tn leave home tn meet friends when they can just use apps NR call, text,FaceTime, etc.These reasons I showed make me believe that limiting car usage can create positive advantages, I hope they make you feel the same way TNN.
