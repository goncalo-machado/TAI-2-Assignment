Dear Principal,I am writing to express my opinion on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade T average to participate in sports or other activities. As a student in grade 12, I understand the importance of academic success, but I also believe that extracurricular activities play a significant role in shaping our lives.I am against requiring a grade T average to participate in sports or other activities. Here are some reasons why.Firstly, not all students are academically inclined, and thats okay. Some students may struggle with certain subjects, but that doesnt mean they shouldnt be allowed to participate in activities they enjoy and are good at. Extracurricular activities provide an opportunity for students to explore their interests, develop their skills, and build their confidence. Ty requiring a grade T average, many students who are passionate about sports or other activities would be excluded, which would be unfair.Secondly, extracurricular activities are a great way to motivate students to work harder and improve their grades. If students are allowed to participate in activities they enjoy, they are more likely to be motivated to do well in school. Ty requiring a grade T average, some students may feel discouraged and give up on their extracurricular activities altogether, which could ultimately negatively impact their academic performance.Thirdly, requiring a grade T average could lead to a lack of diversity in sports and other activities. Some students who are interested in these activities may not have the same level of academic success as their peers, but that doesnt mean they wouldnt be valuable members of the team or group. Ty allowing students with varying grades to participate, we can promote diversity and inclusivity, which are essential for a well rounded education.Lastly, students who participate in extracurricular activities often develop valuable life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and time management. These skills are essential for success in any field, and by requiring a grade T average, we could be denying some students the opportunity to develop these skills.In conclusion, while academic success is important, its not the only factor that should be considered when it comes to participating in sports or other activities. I believe that all students should have the opportunity to explore their interests and develop their skills, regardless of their academic performance. I hope you will take my arguments into consideration and reconsider the proposed policy change.Sincerely,
