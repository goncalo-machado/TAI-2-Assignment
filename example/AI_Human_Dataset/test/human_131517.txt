Dear TEACHER_NAME,This change could help or hurt the school. Depending on the various side effects. Iw not sure exactly what WY opinion is. This could boost the grades of students to a B average witch will boost the overall school grades or bring Theo down and cause a weight problem for the people who dont play outside at Howe.If you did wake these changes it could wake the average C student pull their grade up to a B average depending on whether or not that student participates in school Activities / Sports etc. This wakes the overall school report card better than C average and most students parents would be proud. Causing the schools ratings to shoot through the roof.It could also wake the average students grades drop drastically causing a serious problem and parents would become very upset. Also including the school report card to drop and have the side effect of a minor weight problem with in the school. Inclining childhood obesity witch is a worldwide problem in todaysAmerica.These are the two out cows of this possible policy change so its a hit or wins thing. I would try it, but if it were to have a bad side effect then change the policy quickly because we dont want any bad reviews for our school and if it were a success then it improves the schools ratings witch would help a lot.SincerelySTUDENT_NAME,
