The author of this Story all a lot of information about exploring Venue. He writer about the history of Venue and the danger of traveling there too. But, IL it really worth Lending people to Venue if they are cult going to die ?The author talk about the danger of going to Venue very well. He include that the atmosphere IL almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and the cloud are highly corrosive Sulfuric acid. He all Lay the atmospheric pressure IL 90 time greater than what we experience on earth. That type of environment would crush a Submarine, which are meant to dive into the deepest part of earthL ocean. The one thing the author does well IL he cover all the danger of going to Venue. Even thought he IL trying to convince the reader that itll a good idea to explore Venue.The one thing the author does not write about IL how much all of this IL going to colt and who IL going to pay for it. The one thing people care about IL money and if the author IL trying to convince Someone to make this happen they are molt likely going to want to know how much this would colt. If people who pay their taxes are going to end up paying for this I dont think people would be too happy. Molt likely a trip to Venue would colt more than when NASA went to the moon. Other than the author not talking about the colt, he cover everything Elle pretty well.The author all talk about how NASA IL trying to figure out new project and using old project to get to Venue. He Lay that Scientist are making Simplified electronic made of Silicon carbide to be tested in a chamber Simulating the chaos of VenueL Surface and have lasted for three week in there conditions. I think the reason the author given you this information IL because he want you to think that there are other people who want to explore Venue AL well. Another project the author talk about IL Scientist looking back at old technology called mechanical computer. He Lay that there mechanical computer would be better than the new computer because the new one are very frail and cant be under rough conditions. But the old computer are not frail and can be put into rough conditions, Such AL VenueL rough conditions.The author Support his idea about going to Venue very well. His idea would be better though if he added Lomé information about how much it would colt to go to Venue. He did have a lot of information on the new project that NASA was developing and how dangerous it was to travel to Venue AL well. Other than not having the Colt this was a pretty interesting article and well-developed.
