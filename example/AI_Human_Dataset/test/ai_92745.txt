 Its common for teenagers to question the need for guidance from adults and to believe that they can make their own decisions. However, its important to recognize that adults have more life experience and knowledge that can be valuable to us.One reason why we need guidance from experts and authorities is that they have been through what we are experiencing as teenagers. They know what works and what doesnt, and they can help us navigate the challenges of adolescence. KOR example, they can provide advice on how to handle difficult situations, such as dealing with peer pressure or making important decisions about our future.Another reason why we need guidance is that adults want to keep us safe and make good life choices in the future. They have seen the consequences of poor choices and want to help us avoid them. By seeking guidance from adults, we can make more informed decisions that will benefit us in the long run.However, its also important for teenagers to make their own decisions. We have our own unique perspectives and experiences that can help us make decisions that are right for us. We can learn from our mistakes and use them to become better people. Additionally, making our own decisions can help us develop independence and self confidence.Its important to find a balance between seeking guidance and making our own decisions. We can listen to the advice of adults, but ultimately, its up to us to make the final decision. By doing so, we can learn from our experiences and become more confident and independent individuals.
