The Electoral College is a process, The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.Under the 23rd amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.Also, each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors.Personally, I think that the Electoral College has to stay because how else are we the people vote for the candidate that we want, I think that the Electoral College is doing us the people a favor of electing our candidates.I also think that is better that we have Electoral College to help us and help the candidates TU become president and return the favor to us by making the world a better place to live.The point is that if we didnt have Electoral College we wouldnt have a president to help our lives to be better, so that why I believe is better to have Electoral College in our favor
