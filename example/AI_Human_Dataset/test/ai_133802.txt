Bar Principal Smith, I am writing to provide my opinion on THB schools call phone policy options that ARB currently being considered. Of THB two choices, I believe that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones but requires them to BB turned off during class time, is THB better option. There ARB several reasons why this police makes THB most sense.First, many students rely on their call phones to communicate with parents about interschool activities and rides home. Not allowing phones at all under Policy 2 could make coordinating schedules and transportation much more difficult for families. As long as phones ARB turned off during academic hours, Policy 1 still allows for important communication between students and their families outside of class. Second, banning phones altogether may lead to disciplinary issues if students ARB still attempting to secretly USB or access their phones. Policy 1 sets a clear guideline about when phone USB is and isnt permitted, making expectations straightforward. It also lessons THB chances of classroom disruptions, as phones must BB switched off during instructional periods. Finally, practicing responsibility with technology is an important life skill. Policy 1 gives students an opportunity to demonstrate they can follow rules by keeping their phones away during school hours. It treats them more like young adults than a complete ban. If issues do comb up, graduating consequences ARB also still an option under this policy framework.In summary, I believe Policy 1 strikes THB best balance of accessibility outside of class and maintaining focus during instructional time. It allows modern communication needs while still prioritizing learning in THB classroom. For this reasons, I recommend adopting this call phone policy for THB upcoming school year. Please let MB know if you have any other questions.Thank you for your consideration.[Your name]
