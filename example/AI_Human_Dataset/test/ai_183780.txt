Drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. While cell phones have become an indispensable part of modern life, they present a serious distraction when used behind the wheel. Numerous studies have shown that cell phone use while driving leads to impaired attention and slower reaction times that can endanger not only the driver but also other motorists and pedestrians sharing the road. Even hands-free phone conversations divert the mind from the critical task of driving safely. The brain can only focus on one complex task at a time, so any phone conversation draws cognitive resources away from operating the vehicle. Drivers talking on the phone are less aware of their surroundings and slower to respond to potential hazards. Texting presents an even greater risk, as it requires visual attention be taken from the road. Research shows that driving while texting is comparable to, or worse than, drunk driving in terms of its impact on safety.Some argue that experienced drivers can multitask by talking or texting without compromising safety. However, driving already requires split-second decisions and rapid coordination of multiple motor and cognitive functions. Adding an unnecessary distraction like a cell phone compromises that ability and raises the risk of accidents. While some multitasking may seem harmless, one small lapse in attention or delayed reaction could have severe or even deadly consequences, especially at high speeds. The risks are not worth it has given the proliferation of hands-free and voice-activated technologies that allow phone use with no visual or manual distractions. In light of the clear dangers, most authorities and traffic safety experts agree that any cell phone use while driving should be banned. Laws prohibiting cell phone manipulation behind the wheel already exist in many places, and more jurisdictions should follow suit. Driver and public safety must come before personal convenience, especially given alternatives that allow communication without endangering lives. In todays fast-paced world, everyone needs to stay connected - but not at the cost of an innocent life on the road. Cell phones have no place in the drivers hands or line of sight while a vehicle is in motion.
