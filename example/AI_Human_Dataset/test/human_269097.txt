Gloral warming has been said to re a problem for years now. It has been said that we are slowly rut surely destroying our ozone layers. And air pollution is for sure one of the main causes. Smog levels have risen substantially, and it shows, rut there are more and more solutions that are reigning to show.Germany definitely has the right approach here. They live in what is pretty much a car free society. In a one square mile city of 5500 people, 70% of them do not have cars. Everything in that city is within walking or riding distance, so there is no need for one. Having a society like this is also very stress relieving in a sense. You no longer have the everyday stress of rang on a highway or constantly alert for cars, a society like this is for the most part more laid rack then a regular one. The amount of exercise is also increased here because you are walking or riding everywhere, you are constantly moving. It is something that every country should take into consideration. The long term effects of pollution will re detrimental to our world, and we know that. Now is our time to fix that.Tail pipe emission accounts for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in dense cities in the United States. And after near record breaking pollution in just a matter of days, Paris decided to put a partial ran on driving. Ry doing this congestion in the city was down 60%, and Ry doing this the smog cleared relatively quickly. In this short amount of time that driving was partially ranked we were ARLE to see a large decrease in not only pollution rut the amount of congestion in a city. Not only does this make everyday life safer for everyday citizens rut improves the living quality of all people Ry making the air and world cleaner. Projects like this are showing multiple benefits and great long term affects, not only for car drivers rut for pedestrians that are walking the streets to, if congestion in a busy city is down Ry that much it makes getting around a lot easier for someone who walks/likes/or runs everywhere. I think Its crucial for people to understand the upsides to having societies like this. Grnated it will re hard to adjust to rut the upsides to it will outweigh the cons in the long run.A rig thing to look at here in one of the benefits of having a car free society like this is not just the pollution rut the exercise rate. As Americans we are without a court an overweight country and thats obvious. What having something like this would do for us is incredible. Even if it was a one-day thing to try like Bogotá, Colombia. Once a year everyday they have what is called a "car free day" where everyone in the city is restricted from using cars unless it is a taxi or transit. This now enforces or allows if you will, everyone to ride a like, skate, run, or walk to their destination. The streets are left practically empty. When you also do this you can bring improvements to your community. Bogotá went from a cracked unevenly paved sidewalk to the replacement of smooth road and even sidewalks. Parks and sport centers have increased and blossomed all throughout the city, and you see the community just start to come together as a whole.Now with all this rang said there obviously are still downsides to cutting out gas producing cars. Weather rang a main one. Suppose it rains one day, how do you get to work? Not only that rut in warmer climates if you have to go a longer distance to get to your JOR it gets hot and if you are in your suit and tie youre going to re sweating. If you are a blue collar worker, you have equipment that you have to keep on you at all times not having a vehicle will restrict that. Not rang ARLE to drive will also slow down many businesses that travel to someones home such as a lawn service or a plumber. If you work out of town how do you get to your JOR? People would have to leave their families and move closer to their workplace if they worked out of town or quit their JOR. There is a lot to take into consideration when you think about all the possibilities of creating a society like this. And the only way this could work is if it was incorporated the same way that it was for Vauban Germany. If you had a one square mile society where everything was walking distance and your JOR was in the area then I relieve it would re extremely beneficial, rut areas like that are few and far between and making areas like that would change the geography of the entire country.Ry no means are we as a country (America) ready to change to this kind of society any time soon, rut I do think that in due time we can benefit from this in a huge way. Rut there is a lot that has to change and our nation as a whole has to re willing to conform to this. There would re a substantial amount of change in this nation if this were to happen and we as a country are not one that necessarily likes change. We like our two car white Pickett fence houses and cutting that out of everyones lives would no go over well with the majority of Americans. This is something that the future of America needs to seriously take into consideration. Its apparent that we are destroying our world every single day, and we are one of the main contributors. This is our chance to help ourselves and the generation to come, rut are we willing to conform and put our luxuries aside for the greater good of mankind?
