What if everybody did have an after school activity? Would it technically be a good thing? I disagree with the principle. I think that requiring everybody to have an extracurricular would be too demanding. There are also more reasons why I disagree with the principle. I will be writing about the reasons that I disagree with the principle.Some kids dond do extracurricular activities because they have stuff home and family related. Some kids wouldnt have a ride back home from these activities. Now, I know that youre thinking, "Cant they ask their friends?" But honestly, is there every friend for every person who doesnt have a ride? Why do you think there is a such thing as a taxi now? And some children, including myself, live farther away than most kids in their school. Not many parents are willing to drive far away for a child that isnt theirs. Also, there are some religions that do certain rituals on a daily basis, at certain times. Like prayers, or temple visits, etc.: Some children just have a bedtime. So not every one could make it to these activities.A lot of children that do after school activities have homework and chores to do when they come home. There would be a less likely chance of these getting done, if everybody had an after school activity. Some kids struggle while they are at school, and they use their time at home to study and try to help gain their academic skills. If they are like me, a lot of kids cant really focus at school and usually finish projects and stuff of that sort at home. Some children just cant balance school and extracurricular activities and either stop doing the activity, or lack academically.Along with the other things that I mentioned, some parents/guardians of the students cant afford the extra things that go along with doing these activities. For example: A lot of boys could play sports like basketball and football, but there are expenses to these things. You have to buy helmets, knee pads, shoulder pads, shoes, socks, food for games, and practice attire. Even things other than sports require paying something. Things like art supplies, musical instruments, money for costumes or outfits. There are some after school activities that dont require money, but most do. I have met a majority of kids parents that just dont want to pay the money for the sport that their child wants to do.These are some of the reasons that I disagree with the principle. They are valid and practical. Im thinking about the many reasons why kids dont do after school activities and why it is important to understand these kinds of situations. I have met many kids who have wanted to do a sport, but cant because of a valid reason, like the ones I have listed. You have to take into consideration why everyone isnt doing an extracurricular activity now, and be satisfied with the ones that try and/or do.
