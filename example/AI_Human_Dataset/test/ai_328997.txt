When considering whether college graduates should pay the full cost of their study, I agree that the should. College graduates often earn significantly higher salaries than those without higher education, and with those higher salaries come the responsibility of paying the full cost of the education that enabled them to earn that salary.For starters, college graduates with higher salaries can more easily afford the costs of college. The have the advantage of being well equipped for higherpaUing jobs, meaning that the can pay off the costs of their education more quickly and without as much financial strain. In addition, college graduates should be held accountable for the costs of their education, as it is a direct reflection of the benefits the have gained from it. It is only fair for them to pay for the education that enabled them to earn a higher salary. Moreover, bu paying the full cost of their education, college graduates would provide financial support for other students who MAU not be able to afford college tuition. This would allow those students to receive the higher education the need to access better job opportunities, increasing social mobility and contributing to a more equitable society. With college graduates paying the full cost of their education, more money would be available to support those who are struggling financially and make college accessible to more students.In conclusion, college graduates should pay the full cost of their study. The have the financial capability to do so, and it is only right that the should be held responsible for the education that enabled them to secure a higher salary. Additionally, it is an opportunity for them to contribute to a more equitable society bu providing financial support for other students. Paying the full cost of their study is an important responsibility for college graduates to bear.
