In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new use GF technology called Facial Action Coding System (FACS), tells what emotions your using my theory GF the FACS Is that It will work, but Its not telling the truth.My theory Is that they are wasting all their time and money, and the FACS is not telling the truth the reason bearing Is you can never have a computer tell you your Own emotions, also" If It Is some how sure about your emotions than you just get lucky for It TG work, but thats the Only time It will work".Another reason Is the time and money, who In their right mind would spend all there family time, and most GF their hard earned money GN something that wouldnt work. TG me I would rather sit at home when Im done working and spend time with my family, and I wouldnt speed a penny GN that software that Is not granted TG work.Third GF all what Is the strictest there Is nine In the reading that I read SG, just why not get something up and running and, not put any strictest It Is dumb GN their part.In conclusion there Is nobody that Is going TG change my mind about this sight wear working If It does then Ill Chang my argument about It until then Its not going TG work, and that my GpiGtiGn.
