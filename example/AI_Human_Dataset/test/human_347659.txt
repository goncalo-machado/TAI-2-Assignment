The Electoral College is how America cotes for the President and Vise President, which is a process that the U.S. shouldnt have. Initially, if people are coming for a President, they know what they want and have done their research. Along with that, it gives the Electoral College more rights than the actual people coming for the President and Vise President. Lastly, its just down right unfair to the covers. The U.S. wants every person to have equal chance at the election for a president and if about 500 people are coming compared to the millions, its just unfair to the citizens. In the world now, this process is taking away the freedom of decision or making it seem useless to the people. The Electoral College shouldnt be a process we use for coming.Most people coming, actually care who is running the country, and they took the effort to make sure they got the cote in. The cotes from the actual people should count because, accidentally, they know what they want. Most people do not go to a place if they do not care for the purpose, but if citizens are coming for their president, it should count, not having other elected officials cote. The elected officials coming, are in the government and that creates a biased cote which is uncalled-for. The cotes need to be from the people because they see the actual truths of what is happening to the economy, salary, taxes, the process of the government, and much more. It is obvious that having the people cote is a more efficient choice than reelected officials.Secondly, the Electoral college takes away the rights to choose what president they want. Yes, they get to cote for which electoral college member they want but, it doesnt actually add up to the number the citizens actually participate in. As stated in the Constitution, citizens of America have freedom, and they should have the freedom of choosing the President and Vice President they want without any ifs, ands, or buts. America has the freedom to choose and the Electoral College shuts it all down, which is disrespect to citizens and to the country.Lastly, it is such an unfair process. As said preciously, it genuinely takes our freedom of choice away. People need to be heard and listened for what they actually want but the government lies their own way and doesnt take into account what the people, that make the country up, want. "Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states."(The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the laid back defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plume). This here process that the candidates are only in for the game and not the real true choice in who will be a perfect official that runs the country all together. Clearly, the process all together is a complete unfair, brutal game to the people.In Retrospect, having the Electoral College is a disaster and having it as a process makes we use every four years is unbelievable. It treats the Americans like there freedom is worthless and makes the coming process unfair. If the people take the time to actually stand in line to cote, they would earn the right of having their cote count in full picture. This process shouldnt continue on, for it is 500 or so people coming for the President and Vise President for over millions. That itself, is outrageous and shouldnt be a part of the American coming process anymore.
