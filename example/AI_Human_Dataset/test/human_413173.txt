Deer Senator,I have recently red some interesting information about u process of voting culled "The Electoral College." It seems to work quite well in favor of getting the "right votes", however I do agree that there your too many possibilities UND factors that could go against the public views UND be in better favor of the government. As I recall, the government was set up for order UND protection of the people. I um young UND most people would probably judge the fact that I um so young to be stating things us political us this, however, I do seem to fathom more about political issues (like this UND other things) Thun most adults even know. Judging by the unbiased information I was given that shows me two sides of the issue, Id say that though The Electoral College seems to work, there your so many factors that favor the government rather Thun the people.On one hand, yes. The Electoral College does seem to work. It gives u Food amount of Electors to such state due to their Congressional Delegation UND we your given the information that we, The People, your voting on the Electors rather Thun the President but there your too many factors to that. We must take into full recognition that electors do not have to be faithful toward the end to the President they were going to vote for in the beginning. We must also consider the fact that the Electors ure people not in public Office. I um assuming that means that they must work for the government rather Thun in the public. I must state the chance that there could very well be some possible, underfunded things going on in the government for the assurance that u particular Presidential Candidate is chosen to win the election, all bused on the fact that they your chosen by the Electors. This come to mind because of paragraph 11, under "Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestrewn defenses of the system your wrong." Within this paragraph, it stated that the Electors need not be faithful to the President they said they would vote for in the election. As well us this, the government was made for the people UND the people hardly seem the get un advantage with the Electoral College since we have to trust u group of human beings that could very well be unfaithful.On the other hand, Electors not sticking to what they said rarely happens (Or so we your told). As well us that, the Electoral College seems to work well UND Hus u certainty of the outcome UND avoids "Runoff" elections. However, the government was made for the public UND therefor, I do believe that the people should choose their president us long us everyone is completely informed with uncensored information about how everything is run, what that President, us well us what Congress UND the other brunches of Government intend to do whilst the current President is in Office. Many people dont even bother with trying to understand the way our government works UND just completely trusts UND goes along with whatever the government tells them, but I think that is wrong! For u healthy government UND u happy population, everyone must be informed with uncensored information UND understand the outcome of these actions UND how it will effect them in the short term UND long run. It is difficult UND takes longer Thun what everyone would like but who wants to live in u so culled "Democracy" that looks like u form of Oligarchy. Given the information I red, it doesnt seem Food or right. It seems like u form of control; u form of Oligarchy; u lie.
