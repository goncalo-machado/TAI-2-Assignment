Did you know Venus surface, tempertures average over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is ninety times greater than what we experience on our own planet?The author supports the idea that studying the planet Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because earth should not be limited by the dangers of exploring and expanding the human eye.As the curiosity of the humans eye wanting to figure out what new discoveries they can go to and end up in.The authors explanation of trying to make this challenge a reality and striving to see whats on the other side because human curiosity will likely lead us into many other explorations that are imagination can hold.In the article of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" they state that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4 their theory of Venus was that it was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of lifejust like earth.

Furthermore explaining that our closest option to visiting another planet similar to earth would most likely be Venus.In the article of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the National Aeronautics and Space Administration which is NASA is working on approaches of studying Venus with electronics made of silicon carbide and have them tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface. In paragraph 7 they talk about how using old technology that was being used in World war two would be better to discover Venus than using are previous technology because the shocking part about old technology was that they make calculations by using gears and levers and would not require any electricity. They also state that even if modern computers are enormously powerful, flexable, and quick they can not with stand the physical conditions of Venus. Explaining the authors idea of them wanting to discover and expand their curiosity and many more adventures that it can lead too.The authors idea is explained threw out the article how astronomers and pioneers should continue to explore and continue to strive on thinking whats on the other side. As they show and represent that they are using there old technology to try to reach the impossible to make it possible but also using Venus as a place if needed to be used as the nearest option for a planetary visit. This is what striving and hunger of human curiosity can lead us too and could lead humans to many more adventures.
