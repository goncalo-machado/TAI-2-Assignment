Self-reliance is an essential human characteristic that is both necessary and beneficial. It is the ability to make decisions and cope with the consequences, both good and bad, in order to achieve a certain goal. It cultivates a sense of independence and autonomy that is necessary for growth and personal development. In real life, self-reliance can be seen as a problem-solving tool when faced with various obstacles. For example, a student who is struggling to write a difficult essay may need to rely on themselves in order to overcome the challenge. Seeking help and guidance from others can be helpful, but it is ultimately up to the student to make the final decisions and take the necessary steps to reach success. The same applies to nature, where animals and plants must use self-reliance to survive in their ever-changing environment. They must navigate their surroundings, make decisions, and weather the consequences in order to secure resources and thrive. The thought process behind self-reliance is personal and divergent. It requires the individual to assess the situation, consider potential options, and weigh the pros and cons of each decision before making a final choice. The decisions we make can have a considerable impact on the outcome, so it is important to consider all the consequences and think logically before we act. In conclusion, self-reliance is an incredibly valuable trait that is both necessary and beneficial. It is impossible to progress without the ability to make informed decisions and face the consequences alone. Ultimately, self-reliance is the key to personal growth and success.
