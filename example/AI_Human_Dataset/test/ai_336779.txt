Advantages of Limiting Car UsageLimiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This essay will explore the benefits of reducing automobile dependency, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, promotion of alternative transportation, and the creation of more pedestrian friendly communities.One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthals article, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain car intensive areas in the United States. By reducing automobile dependency, communities can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. This reduction in emissions can have a positive impact on air quality as well.The improvement in air quality is another advantage of limiting car usage. In Robert Duffers article, it is mentioned that the smog in Paris reached levels comparable to Failing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The main culprit for this smog was diesel fuel, which France heavily favors over gasoline due to tax policies. By decreasing car usage, especially diesel fueled vehicles, communities can improve air quality and reduce the negative health effects associated with pollution.Promotion of alternative transportation is another crucial advantage of limiting car usage. Andrew Silkys article describes the carefree day in Bogotá, Colombia, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This event aimed to reduce smog and promote public transportation. By limiting car usage, communities can encourage the use of more sustainable modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also provides individuals with healthier and more environmentally friendly options for getting around.Additionally, limiting car usage can contribute to the creation of more pedestrian friendly communities. In Elisabeth Rosenthals article about the German suburb of Vauban, it is mentioned that street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in this carefree community. Instead, large garages are provided at the edge of the development, emphasizing the prioritization of pedestrians and public transportation. This approach allows for the design of communities that are compact, walkable, and accessible to public transportation. By limiting car usage, communities can create safer and more enjoyable environments for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users.In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, promotion of alternative transportation, and the creation of more pedestrian friendly communities. By reducing automobile dependency and embracing sustainable transportation options, individuals and communities can contribute to a healthier environment and a more enjoyable way of life. It is imperative that society recognizes the benefits of limiting car usage and takes active steps towards achieving a more sustainable future.
