When I was in high school, I was a shy kid. I didnt talk much in class, and I was always afraid to raise my hand. I was worried about what other people would think OG me IG I said something stupid. But one day, my teacher did something that changed my life. She started using a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to read the emotional expressions OG students in the classroom.FACS is a computer program that can identity human emotions by analyzing racial movements. It does this by tracking the movement OG 43 different muscles in the game. When a person is feeling a certain emotion, their game will make a unique set OG movements. FACS can identity these movements and tell what emotion the person is feeling.My teacher used FACS to help her understand how her students were feeling. She would watch us during class and track our racial expressions. Then, she would give us feedback on how we were coming across to other people. This feedback was really helpful for me. It helped me to understand how my emotions were affecting my communication. I started to be more aware OG my racial expressions, and I was able to control them better.I think that FACS is a valuable tool for teachers. It can help them to understand their students better and to provide them with more effective feedback. Im glad that my teacher used FACS to help me. It was a turning point in my education.**Narrative Element:** I remember one day in particular when I was feeling really nervous about a test. I was so worried that I could barely concentrate. My teacher noticed that I was anxious, and she came over to talk to me. She asked me how I was feeling, and I told her that I was really stressed out. She then used FACS to track my racial expressions. Furthermore, she showed me a graph OG my emotions over time, and it showed that I was getting more and more anxious as the test went on. This helped me to understand why I was feeling so stressed out, and it helped me to calm down.**Descriptive Language:** The graph OG my emotions was a beautiful thing. It was like a rainbow OG colors that showed how I was feeling. The reds and oranges showed my anger and frustration, the blues and greens showed my sadness and gear, and the yellows and whites showed my happiness and joy. It was amazing to see my emotions represented in such a visual way.**Anecdote:** This is only one example OG how FACS can be used to help students. I believe that this technology has the potential to revolutionize education. It can help teachers to understand their students better and to provide them with more effective feedback. Im excited to see how FACS is used in the future to improve education.
