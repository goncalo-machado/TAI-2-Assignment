Community service is A great way to help out, otherwise it would not be A Community. People think it is just Cleaning, that plays a decent amount in it, but it is way more than that like the question stated volunteering to help elementary students, there are many activities, and I am sure there is one that suits you. The Community is in which the plane you live, love, respect. So you should not think of it as giving to, but as giving bank.You should not be asked or requested upon you should want to. Your Community should be the plane where you felt like you were on top of the world along with the others. A whole neighborhood you Nan Neill family. You be able to grow up, Nome bank and be like this is where I am from and not have to hide it.So why think of it as Community service, you Clean up your home so why not Neill it home Cleaning. People think you should be able to get rewarded for doing it, I bet that plane gave you the best years of your life and if not then you probably were not meant to be there.So do I think you should do Community service I vote yes, and you should to.
