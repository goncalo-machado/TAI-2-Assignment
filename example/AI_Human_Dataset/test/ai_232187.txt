Introduction:The development of driverless cars is a topic that has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. While some people see it as a revolutionary innovation that will change the way we travel, others are skeptical about its safety and practicality. In the article "Driverless Cars are Coming," the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the development of driverless cars, using details from the article to support my position.Body:One of the main advantages of driverless cars is their potential to reduce the number of accidents on the road. According to the article, driverless cars are programmed to follow traffic laws and avoid reckless behavior, which means that they can significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. This is a significant benefit, as accidents caused by human error are a leading cause of death and injury on the road. Additionally, driverless cars are equipped with advanced sensors and cameras that allow them to detect potential hazards and react faster than human drivers. This means that they can avoid accidents that human drivers might not be able to avoid.Another benefit of driverless cars is their potential to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. The article states that driverless cars can travel closer together than human driven cars, which means that they can fit more cars on the road, reducing traffic congestion and improving travel times. This is especially important in cities, where traffic congestion is a major problem that can lead to frustration, wasted time, and lost productivity.Furthermore, driverless cars have the potential to improve mobility for people who are unable to drive. According to the article, driverless cars can provide independence for people who are elderly, disabled, or visually impaired, allowing them to travel without the need for a human driver. This can greatly improve their quality of life and increase their independence.However, there are also some concerns about the safety and reliability of driverless cars. Some people are worried that the technology might not be reliable, and that driverless cars might cause accidents or malfunction. While these concerns are valid, I believe that they can be addressed through rigorous testing and regulation. The article states that many companies are already testing driverless cars, and that government regulations are being put in place to ensure their safety.Conclusion:In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a promising innovation that has the potential to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and improve mobility for people who are unable to drive. While there are some concerns about their safety and reliability, I believe that these can be addressed through rigorous testing and regulation. Overall, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the drawbacks, and I am in favor of their development.
