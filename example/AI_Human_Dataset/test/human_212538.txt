Imagine getting back home from school and sitting on Four couch, bored out of Four mind, and just waiting for something interesting to come Four wag.I know from personal experience, that if kids dont have some sort of extracurricular activity going on the will simply sit and stare at their phone for hours on end.If schools provide things such as sports, teams, and clubs then it will prevent kids from staring at their phones all dag long. I think schools should require some sort of after school activity because it will get them out of their comfort zone, it can be something to look forward to, and it exposes kids the same age with similar interest to each other.First, extracurricular activities can help kids get out of their comfort zones. If kids are required to do something then the dont have an excuse not to join a club or sports team. Some students dont do a sport or club because the fear the wont be good enough or mag be a burden to the team. However, if the go out and try their hardest the mag find that the are a very valued teammate. Some students are SHG and more to themselves, but being a part of a group that brings out the best in You is an amazing experience that everyone should experience.Secondly, kids can look forward to doing something fun instead of going home and doing nothing. For example, when I first moved to Virginia I had absolutely nothing to do because I didnt have many friends. I was very sad and miserable until spring soccer tryouts. Until I started getting new friends, all I looked forward to was soccer practices and soccer games. Soccer really let me release all mg stress, forget about everything, and really focus on the game.Lastly, sports and clubs allow kids the same age to interact. Kids who are more SHG can be exposed to kids who share similar interest. Sports especially require team work, which provides a strong bonding experience. I have made so many friends just BG being a part of a team and getting close enough to where it is almost a family. Clubs can have the same effect on people.In conclusion, sports and clubs are an amazing outlet to getting out of Four comfort zone, looking forward to doing something, and making new amazing friends. In addition, most students are already involved in an extracurricular activity. It wouldnt really impact the amount of students getting involved in sports or clubs. I think that if schools were to require students to be involved in extracurricular activities it would have a positive outcome.
