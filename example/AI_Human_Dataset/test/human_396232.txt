Radiation, heat and atmospheric pressures are some of the biggest reason that we Heine not gotten to explore that much of the planet we know as Genus.The second planet from the sun is said to be the closest relative to the one we line on today. For years humans Heine thought of Venus as inhabitable, but the author of this article thinks otherwise.The author claims that Venus is the closest and density, in comparison to Earth. He then talks about how Earth, Mars and Venus are all planetary neighbors. Since Venus is one of the closest to us, He claims that it is one of the easier planets to explore. "Humans Heine sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud draped world" Though we Heine sent spacecrafts no one has survived for more than a few hours.As of now Venus is Very dangerous. With atmospheric pressures exceeding earth with 90 times more pressure than us, and temperatures of one 800 degrees, these conditions arent exactly what humans how line on earth, where the max temperature has maybe been 140. But he asks if the conditions are so bad, why are scientist trying so hard to explore the planet. He goes into how Venus uses to Heine a presence just like earth. "Largely with oceans and could Heine supported Various forms of life, like earth.I think what the author is trying to get at is, Maybe one day we can send humans to Genus, and maybe they are start lining there. We are already planning on sending humans to Mars in the near future, it shouldnt be long until NASA looks into sending humans to other planets. And the other closest one, as well as it being similar to earth, is Genus.Even with the dangerous atmosphere of Venus, it still fascinates humans to this day. With the overpopulation of Earth, it is time we look into sending people to other planets. And with Genus being one of the most similar planets in comparison to Earth, it might not be long until we look into sending humans to the planet.
