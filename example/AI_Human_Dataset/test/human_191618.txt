I have the idea that our school should adopted this model that consist in extending the school day two hours. This model come from a system of some businesses have adopted to conserve energy and resources, this model can help student get more involved in their apprenticeship and schools activities.This idea can help student, but it has disadvantages is well, because there will be some students that will take a lot of time to be in the habit because they were accustomed to the normal school day. Also, some students have to work after school, this MCAS if they stay at the school more time, it will less time that they will have to make works hours, but this doesnt affect them too much, because they will attend to the school only four day in a week. This is great because they will have a long weekend to make their tasks and work and help their parents at home with the homes job. One reasons why our school should follow this model is the creations of new classes like: workshop, drama, and studios of art. Student can be involved in every kind of activity to spend their time in something that will help them in their future. Everyone can join up to any program at the school like ROTC this is a great program for some student that are thinking about join up to some militarys branches, as we know the military can give you many benefits perfect, with this program they will get a rich knowledge about it.Many peoples will disagree with this new model of extending the school day two hours because some of them doesnt like the school already. Also, some parents can be disagreed because they think that the students doesnt need that much time at the school thats why the school should make a specific schedule, adding more breaks and activities and then, they will realize that this model of extending the school day two hours will be good, and then student will take advantage of time that they will have to learn more.In example, we have a group of society as we know like some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources. That way the worker have an extra day that can be spent with another work, and they are available to have a second job. This can help them get a better financial life or take that extra time to sped it with their families. In conclusion there are many reason and caress why our school should adopt this model of expending the school day two hours more.
