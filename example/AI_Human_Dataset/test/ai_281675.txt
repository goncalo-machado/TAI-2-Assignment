The uncontrolled proliferation of motor vehicles in our lives has been a significant contributor to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions over the last century. As we look to the future, we must reassess this dangerous dependency. Exploring viable alternatives to our current car culture, such as improving public transit systems, promoting car sharing programs and creating carefree residential zones can greatly benefit our society and environment. The suburb of Vauban in Germany signifies an innovative stride towards a carefree society. Vaubans pioneering residents have embraced life without cars owning a car is not prohibited, but parking spaces are limited and costly (Rosenthal Passage 2). The result of this strategy is impressive  70% of Vaubans families do not own cars (Rosenthal Passage 3). This decrease in car use has coincided with a significant increase in the quality of life in the suburb, with less noise pollution, cleaner air, and a more communal atmosphere.Cities worldwide have also adopted similar measures to limit car usage. The French capital of Paris once enforced a partial driving ban after days of near record pollution which cleared the air of the city significantly (Duffer, Passage 10). Bogotá, Colombia has also experienced the environmentally friendly and socially engaging benefits of having a carefree day when "millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work" (Silky, Passage 20).American society has likewise begun to see a downward trend in car usage. Recent studies have suggested that Americans are driving less and buying fewer cars with each passing year, a trend that could greatly help in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing pollution (RosenthalPassage 29). Companies such as Lord and Mercedes are acknowledging this shift and are starting to rebrand themselves as ‘mobility’ companies rather than merely car manufacturers (Rosenthal, Passages 34). Moreover, technological advancements such as the rise of carpooling apps, better telecommuting capabilities, and shared van services have made commuting less dependent on personal cars (Rosenthal, Passage 35). Indeed, it appears that our relationship with cars is undergoing a fundamental and beneficial change.Limiting car usage can lead to healthier, happier, and more sustainable societies. By embracing trendy and sustainable suburban life, we can ensure a greener future that reduces greenhouse gas emissions drastically, improves air quality, and contributes positively to our overall quality of life. Ultimately, in changing our relationship with cars, we can build communities that are environmentally conscious and economically vibrant, leaving a more sustainable world for future generations.
