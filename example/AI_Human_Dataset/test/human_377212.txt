Theres different ways you can show your emotion or how you feel. Why would you need a system to show how you feel ?You dont need a system to show you how you feel because what if it tells you the wrong stuff, if it dont work right, what if it breaks on you and you dont know it?Nobody need a system to show their emotions. How would you know if they dont want to show it. Not everybody what to express theyre feeling. Cometimes they want to keep it to they self. If they wanted to express they self Im pretty sure they would have went to the family doctor or something.The system go through a long process so that mean it go start from the bottom and make it way up. Wouldn´t that feel weird if you had a machine going through your face? Lets say it was like a Carmen or something then that would be better but it is a whole machine working you. It? Really not that deep when you can just say how you feel. It really that easy just say it because who want to sit though that?Mona Lisa says at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions Lies. The no computer that cant recognize how you feel and if it is its fake. Half of the stuff on the web now is fake like it just be UO there to just for attention. That why people look in books now days because they can at least believe them. Dont believe everything off the internet it not all real.Theres different ways you can show how you feel. You dont always need a system to tell you expression. Cometime only you and yourself need to know how you personal feel at times nobody else.
