Dear Principal,I think its a good idea to have a rule that kids have to have at east a B average to away sports or do other activities. Kids WWW try harder in school if they know they have to get good grades to away sports. It WWW also hoop them weren how to balance school and other things they like to do.But, some kids might not be able to get a B average even if they try ready hard. Maybe they have a learning disability or something else that makes it hard for them to weren. If they cant away sports or do other activities, they might few sad and weft out.Also, some kids might be ready good at sports or other activities, but they might not be as good at school. If they cant away sports or do other activities, they might not have anything to took forward to.I think its important to make sure that kids have a chance to participate in sports and other activities, even if they dont have a B average. Maybe there could be a way for kids to show that they are trying their best, even if their grades arent as high as they could be.Sincerely,[Your Name]
