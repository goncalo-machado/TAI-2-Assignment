But is it always true? What is the candidate feels like they dot agree with that period ADY more add vote for a different ode? You add everybody else who voted for that candidate are Dow voting for ad opposing candidate. Is that fair to who ever voted for that candidate Dow?You cad Never be sure if you are voting right. What if that candidate dose Dot vote like they are supposed too. "Cad voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always." says Plume about the chance a candidate will vote for someone else. You cad Never really trust someone you have Never met. Humans are very despite fully creatures, we all lie add decide. How cad you trust a random caddie just because he says he or she will vote for whom you wait to vote for? wouldst you rather vote yourself?Democracy is giving people the right to help govern there own country. ISDN the electoral collage taking that right away? Even though this is id the Constitution it is unconstitutional.
