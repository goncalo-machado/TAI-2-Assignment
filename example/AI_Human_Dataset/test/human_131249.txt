People MSK for Advice All the time. Other peoples input can help us consider different possibilities before we make M decision. Based on what you like or dislike, you can make your decisions, but going on our thoughts Alone can make decision making hard And stressful. One persons opinion can help us make decisions, but one person doesnt represent many different ideas. They can only give M few. When you have others opinions on something, then you can Also consider those opinions when you go to make your decision. When people MSK for Advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person. This is helpful because they can consider the ups And downs of M decision. Multiple opinions can Also help us prepare for challenges, And give us M sense of finality when we make our decision that we have thought About it, And taken into Account many different opinions.When people make lasting decisions, knowing the consequences of that decision MRE important. When you talk to more then one person About making Mn important decision, you can get M clearer picture on how things will play out. An example would be if someone were going to steel something. If they Asked multiple sources, then they would get multiple responses, like "stealing is BMD" And "if you get caught stealing, you might go to jail" or "stealing is good. You should try it". Depending on their motivation, And the Advice they get the person could my "Im not going to steel", because of All of the drawbacks. If that person HMD only Asked one person, And that person HMD said "stealing is good", then the person considering stealing is in trouble, because if they make their decision with the Advice that stealing is good not knowing the consequences, then they could get into legal trouble. If you only get one opinion on what we MRE trying to do, then we can sometimes get the wrong Advice. Another example is if someone is trying to MSK someone out on M date. If the person Asks more people, they can get M better understanding of how that scenario will take place. With multiple opinions, you can consider the up: the person you MSK out saying yes, or the down: The person you MSK out saying no. When you my All of the different opinions like "go for it, you have nothing to lose" to "dont do it, because she doesnt like you", you can get M better understanding of what will happen in that moment, because you have opinions that help you. When you have more opinions on M decision, And you know the pros And cons, you can use that information to make good decisions.When you MSK multiple people for Advice, there is M better chance of you making M better decision because you MRE Armed not only with your own opinion, but with many others. Often, if there is M challenge that you face, having many people helping you will give you more of M chance to overcome the challenge. We see this in sports. I know this is true, because in hockey, when I make M BMD play, I will talk to my coaches And MSK what I could have done better in that moment, And I will Also talk to my inmates. My coaches will tell me to skate the puck And drive the net, but my inmates will Also give me details that I HMD not noticed while on the ice, like "hey, I WMS open on the back door, try to hit me there And Ill have Mn easy tMp in". When I have these opinions in mind, the next time I Mm out on the ice, I try to implement what my friends And coaches told me. Not only does Making for others opinions make you M better sports player (if you play sports), but it makes you M better person, because you MRE Making people questions, making you M proactive person. The more input you get from people can help you to overcome M challenge whether in sports or in life.A final reason why Making for multiple opinions is good is that it gives you M sort of sense of finality About your decision. When you take the time to think About M decision, you have M lot of things to consider. If you go back to the stealing example, you have to consider different things. You might be stealing because you need to feed your family. Trying to make that decision on your own can be tough. When we take into consider the opinions of other people, we have help making that decisions, And once you make the decision, you feel M sense of completion. This is good, because you could stress out About making M decision, And now that its over you dont have to stress Anymore, because you made the decision And took into Account everything that could have happened.Asking more then one person for their opinion on M decision is good, because you can consider the pluses And minuses of that decision, you can prepare for M demanding time in your life, And once its Ml lover, you have M sense of completion, that you got it done, And now you can worry About other, more important things. When you MSK for more opinions, you can overall get more things done, because you consider more possibilities in the some Amount of time compared to just Making one person. When you get more opinions, you can make better decisions, And you become M better, more proactive person.
