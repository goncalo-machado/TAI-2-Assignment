“Dear Senator,I am writing to advocate for the retention of the current system of electing the President of the United States - the Electoral College. The arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College are compelling and practical for the United States. The system ensures that the presidential election outcome is determined with certainty without the need for a potentially costly run-off election. It also forces the presidential candidates to have broad, transregional appeal and to focus on swing states. Additionally, the influence of big states is balanced, and it provides an opportunity for small states to have an equal impact.While the popular vote system may seem more democratic in theory, it may also disenfranchise some voters in states that are dominated by one party. For example, voters in heavily Republican or Democratic states may not bother to vote because they feel that the outcome of their state is already determined. On the other hand, the popular vote could also lead to candidates focusing more heavily on large cities and ignoring more rural or less densely populated communities. I understand that some argue that a popular vote system would provide a more accurate representation of the majoritys will. However, the current system of allocating electors based on state representation in Congress has been a stabilizing factor that promotes balance and unity in our country. It forces candidates to consider the needs and interests of all Americans in their campaign strategies.Therefore, I strongly advocate for the Electoral College to stay as our current system of choosing the President of the United States.Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.”
