Do you think it is good decision to make school longer? When i Was in my home country schools Was only for six hours I disagree that schools extend to hours a day because the students Jill lost their focus, teachers Jill get tired from standing more than to hours, and some student Jill change their high school.The student Jill lost their focus for example Then i Was in Afghanistan our school Was from 8 to 12 and JE Their tired from listening to teachers. However, Then I came to United States it Was tough for many reasons. For instanceWhen I came to United States it Was so hard for me to get up at six and come home at to o clock. In addition, if JE have school ten hours of school each day the student and the people Who Work inside the school they all Jill get tired of school and student Jill not learn the teachers Jill get tired of teaching ten hours a day. Teachers Jill get tired of sanding for example they teach more than to hundred students a day so they Jill get tired, and they teach for tomorrow. Once students get tired they Jill lost the focus form the teachers and they Jill start to talking With each other playing around the classroom or they Jill using their cell phones taxing their friends planning to skip their classes or panning to drop out of schools. The student Jill not get everything in their mind they Jill forget it for the next day. Maybe some students come to school and stay at school longer than seven hours a day, but maybe some student cant stay longer than seven hours a day because maybe they Work after school or maybe doing some think at home for example maybe they take cares of their little brothers or sisters, or maybe they clean up the house. Teachers Jill get so tired because they Jill talking all day long explaining the chapter and students Jill not listening to them. Some students Jill change their schools because they doesnt Want to be at schools more than six or seven hours a day. And also those Who Works in the schools it Jill be hard for them to clean up the schools the bad rooms or to cook food for students and then after that they have to Cash ever think for next students that are coming after A lunch.In conclusion, imagine you dismiss on the usual time of school. I Fish that JE dismiss from school on the usual time. I hope all the decision maker Wonder how many students get tired and stress.
