 High school students should graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. There are several reasons why this is the case. Firstly, students have a good idea to finish high school early. For example, some students take courses during the summers and some of them take courses during the evenings. This allows them to graduate early and have more time to pursue their goals. In addition, some students may not be able to take elective courses. When this happens, they will graduate early and have more time to focus on their core subjects.Secondly, students will have more time to work and save money for college. For example, some students work hard to save money to pay for college. When they graduate early, they will have more time to work and save money before entering college. This will allow them to enter college with more financial stability and less debt.Finally, students will have more time to achieve their goals early. For example, some students have a clear idea of what they want to achieve in their future, and graduating early will allow them to start working towards their goals sooner. This will give them a head start on their careers and allow them to achieve their goals more quickly.Some people argue that high school students should not graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. They say that students will not be able to take elective courses. However, this is not necessarily true. Many schools offer summer and evening courses that allow students to take elective courses while still graduating early.In conclusion, there are several reasons why high school students should graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. By graduating early, students will have more time to pursue their goals, work and save money for college, and achieve their dreams. These benefits make it clear that graduating early is a smart choice for high school students.
