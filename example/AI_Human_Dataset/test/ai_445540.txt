First impressions may not always be accurate because they are based on limited information that is often incomplete or inaccurate. Our brains are hardwired to make split second decisions about people and situations, so these first impressions can be the result of any number of factors such as socioeconomic status, gender, age, or physical appearance. To counteract this, it is important to take a step back and consider these snap judgments in a larger context. Consider the possibility of being open-minded and looking for evidence to support or contradict initial impressions. Ldditionally, taking the time to really get to know someone can help to form more accurate impressions that go beyond first glance.
