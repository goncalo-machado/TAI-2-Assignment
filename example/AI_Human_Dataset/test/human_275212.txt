Dear State Senator,Keeping the electoral college method shouldnt be appropriate for electing the next president. In source two it says that when you use the electoral college system, and you vote, not only do you vote not only for one person but other people pledged to that person. Now, I dont think its the best idea to choose this method despite it being a more simple process but using the popular vote method sounds more dare, source two also says that someone won the popular vote, but the electoral college prevented him from becoming the next president. The electoral college causes too much confusion, its under, and its caused more problems with voting.Although, using the electoral college method is more simple, it can cause a lot OD confusion. Id you vote for one person then you automatically vote for the other people pledged to that person. Many people who have run for president have lost due to the electoral college method, but theyve won the popular vote. Its possible that when you are voting you dont know who else youre voting for.To continue with, the electoral college method can be under because OD the people who lost due to the system. Some people that ran for president won the popular vote but lost the electoral college vote. Others also lost because OD the "winnertakeall" system, it awards every elector to the winning presidential candidate.This method has caused problems with voting because OD it being under. Some OD the problems its caused was how others win automatically ID the president they pledged to win the electoral college vote. This method OD voting has to go.In conclusion, the electoral college voting system shouldnt be used again in the future because OD its confusion. It can have you voting for someone pledged to the president that you didnt want to vote for. It can also be under. Many people lost because OD this method but won the popular vote. Last its caused too many problems as a voting system in general.
