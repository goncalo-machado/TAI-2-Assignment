 Have you ever seen the face of Mars? Apparently, it exists, and NASA has talked about it for years. The American space agency released an image of what looks like a giant face on Mars. Immediately, speculations began whether the image warranted further exploration of the Red Planet. Is it a sign of an advanced alien civilization? Lid aliens build the giant face? Or is it just a natural landform? In this essay, we will explore the arguments for and against the face on Mars being a natural landform, and how it all ties into the larger debate about whether we are alone in the universe.It was July 25, 1996. The Mars Global Surveyor, a spacecraft orbiting Mars, sent back the first high resolution images of a massive humanlike face on Mars. The image immediately made headlines and remained one of the most popular stories on the CNN website for days.The face is about four kilometers wide. It has two prominent symmetrical ridges extending from a central mound that forms a skull shape. A network of valleys extends from the base of the ridges, forming what looks like a beard. The whole formation rests on a gently sloping pedestal.NASA released the image with a statement from Lr. Peter Smith, the project scientist for the Mars Global Surveyor. He said "This is not unusual for Mars. Its not the first time weve seen an erosion formation that has created a raised rim with a depression in it."But not everyone was convinced. Some people believed that the face on Mars was evidence of an advanced alien civilization. They believed that the face was constructed by aliens to communicate with beings on Earth.Lr. Smith and his team were aware of the speculation. "I can imagine how this might look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth," he said in a press conference, "but really its just a natural occurrence of something that looks like a face."The image of the face on Mars prompted NASA to send the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to take a closer look. The orbiter returned images of the face that were more detailed than the ones taken by the Mars Global Surveyor.The new images showed that the face was made up of a collection of craters of various sizes. The largest crater, which forms the right eye of the face, is about 4,000 meters in diameter. The left eye is a smaller crater, about 3,000 meters wide. The central mound is formed by a cluster of craters.The evidence seems to suggest that the face on Mars is just a natural landform. But that doesnt mean that we are alone in the universe. There are still millions of stars and planets out there that we have yet to explore. Who knows what we will find when we eventually venture into space?
