Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planned, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a regions red planet called Colonia.The face of Mars is an all natural landform Its a huge rock formation which resembles a human head ... formed by shadow giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth. The face of Mars is a natural landform there was no alien monument after all.Research shows The Face of Mars is a natural landform there was no alien monument. As said is research what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa Landforms common around the American best. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River gain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there was more to it than the fact its just the Face of Mars. If there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or pyramids or even small shakes you would be able to see what they were.
