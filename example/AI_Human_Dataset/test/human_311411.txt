I do not think that their should be driverless cars. Driverless cars still need a driver in them. They also can drive around or know if a road is getting fixed. The cars could also be dangerous. These are reason way i think we should no have driverless cars.First reason way we should have driverless cars, is because they cars still need to have a driver in them. The car should not be considered driverless if they still need a driver to take over just in case of an accident ahead. The cars also do not have eyes can not see, now will it work at night. Also, during the winter the driverless cars would have a lot of accidents because of snow and ice.Second reason, is the cars would not know when their is a dead end or the roads are getting fixed. These cars could run off the road if a bridge was not complete. The computer hardware could go down in the middle of driving and people could die. These cars are not humans, and could kill lots of people because of simple mistakes.My final reason is these cars can be dangerous because now would they know when children are running through the streets. These cars would not be safe around children or elder people. In the article its says "If the technology fails and someone was injured, who is at fault driver or the manufacture?". How will the law handle situations like these, who would be at fault they would not know.I do not think they should be driverless cars for many reasons. Their are also, some good reason way we could have them. A couple reason are they dont use as much gas, they do thing that humans can not do, but these cars can be dangerous to the community. I think that their should not be driverless cars, and cars should say now they are.
