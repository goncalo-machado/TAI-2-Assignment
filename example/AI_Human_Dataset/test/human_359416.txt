Yes, I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should try something new. They can see what activities they like to do, they can become friends with new people, and they can do more bands on activities.Students can see what activity they like to do. Some students never done an activity before. So they may want want to try something now. They may want to try a sport they never did before. Students may already have an activity they like to do and they want to keep doing it. Some people have a hard time trying to find what they like do.Students can become friends with other people. Some people dont have friends and they want to make friends. Some students have friends and their friends are doing a different activity. Some students dont want to feel left out so they make friends.Students can do more bands on activities. Some students do better when its bands on. They like to be able to touch it and see it. Some students would rather heard it and can remember it like that.Students should participate in one extracurricular activity. They can see what things they like to do, they can become friends with other people, and they can do more bands on activities. They will want to do it again and have fun.
