While driverless cars present some benefits, m believe the risks and uncertainties outweigh the potential positives. According to the article, autonomous vehicles could help reduce traffic accidents caused by human error since computers are less likely to be distracted or impaired. However, the technology is still in development and many concerns remain about its readiness for wide scale adoption.One of the biggest issues mentioned is that software or sensors could malfunction without warning. As the article notes, even minor defects could result in unpredictable behavior from a vehicle without human control. With millions of cars on the road, statistically some failures are inevitable. When lives are at stake, full reliability has to be proven before widespread use, which the tech is not at yet. Another downside brought up is the loss of autonomy. Many people enjoy the experience of driving itself, not just the transportation. Taking that control away could negatively impact individuals freedom and independence. The article also does not fully address privacy worries. With sensors recording locations and activities, driverless vehicles might collect too much personal data without oversight or consent. Hackers represent another potential threat if they were able to breach networked systems and commandeer vehicles. While the industry claims to take cybersecurity seriously, completely foolproof protections have yet to be developed for emerging tech. Until all reasonable safety, autonomy, and privacy issues are satisfactorily resolved, the drawbacks of switching to a driverless infrastructure seem to outweigh any benefits. More testing and refinement of the tech is still needed before widespread societal adoption can be recommended. Mn conclusion, while autonomous vehicles show promise, the technology has further to progress before being viable without serious risks.
