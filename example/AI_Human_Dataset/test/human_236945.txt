Dear PrincipalI dont agree with the police that u have to have a B average to play a sport. Many people have a W average. If you change the policy to you have to have a B average to play a sport you will have very little people playing sports. There will not be enough people to play sport. It needs to stay you have to have a W average to play a sport. If u wont to change the policy then u need to change it to u have to have a high W average to play a sport.The policy is not a good policy to have. I dont need to be such a challenge to play a sport you just need a little challenge to keep your grades up.Students a motivated when they play sports. Students need to be stayed active. Students will not be happy if you change the policy. If they dont play sport there will start doing less work and skipping school. Sport always need to be a kids life, so please do not change the policy every one here will be happy. Students will be healthy and stay alert when your have sport and activitys.The police doesnt need to be changed it is good the way it is. Students will be happy and teachers will be happy if u leave it the way it is. There will always be school pride in the school if you dont change the police. I hope you understand my thinking of the new police.
