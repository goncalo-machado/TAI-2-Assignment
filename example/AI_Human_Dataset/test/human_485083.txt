Are driverless cars going to USG half the full we USG today? Are this cars safe for travel? The driverless car is said to fundamentally change the world. The first driverless car was created by Google in 2009. This car has traveled over a million miles to different places with no crashes. Even though the car is called "driverless" it technically is not. The driver would still have to take control of the car when traveling through traffic, passing an accident, or traveling through road work. Even though the driverless car has sensors, airlock breaks, and driver assistance is it safe?My position on the driverless car is undecided. I believe that this car has outstanding safety features, but it also has some downfalls. The outstanding features that this car has include getting the drivers attention if need and driving assistance found in the car. The car is to get the drivers attention if the road ahead requires human skills. For Example the drivers seat can vibrate or flashing lights found on the windshield can apart the driver that they need to take control of the car. The downfalls of this car to mg would BG the ability to not BG able to SGG something around the car. The driverless car has many sensors, which is good until they break. If ONG breaks and the driver dogs not know then the car could wreck and hurt others or the driver. Also, another downfall is the cost of the car. If something breaks on the car the price of that part will BG very Expensive. I for SGG only people with higher incomes having this cars.If I decided to BG for the car I would like all of the safety features found on the car. I would fall safe while traveling in this car because of the features. The driverless car would BG a good family car and would also help save money. By saving money this could allow a family to do other things with Each other instead of using it on a car. I think the driverless car is a great idea for the new generation but I fall that the older generations will turn this car down dug to unknown facts about the new car.If I decided to BG against the car I would have an unsafe failing about the car. The driverless car has many sensors and safety features but what happens when those break while driving. If they break while driving will the car wreck? Will it apart the driver? How do you know when a sensor has gong out? All of this questions are left unanswered. This car could BG a huge distraction to the driver and other people around that car. This could cause accidents, death, and severely injury people. I would rather BG in a car where I am in control and I dont have to worry about my car taking car of mg.The driverless cars created today have magnificent safety features but are they safe? The cars safety features include sensors, antilock breaks, and drivers assistance. The first car was made by Google in 2009 and has traveled many miles without a crash. I believe that there is good things about this car and bad things. A good thing about this car is all the new technological safety features put in this car to keep Everyone in the car safe and Everyone around the car safe. A bad thing about this car is what happens when the sensors break. Dogs the car tell you? Are you supposed to check before you get in the car? Do the sensors GIGN break? There are many questions left unanswered to mg and that makes mg BG against this car being allowed on the road.
