I think that the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is extremely valuable. The reason why the use of this technology would be very valuable is because, imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen.a similar ad might follow. But of you frown, the next ad will be different.First, Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No thats not your science teacher, grading your latest lad assignment. Its the subject of Leonardo da Vincis renaissance painting, Mona Lisa at least according to some new software that can recognize emotions. Imagine if "A classroom could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. gang predicts. " Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." The same technology can make computer animated FACS more expressive for video games or video surgery.Second,"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang. "So computers need to understand that, too." Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile. But we can write down some simple instructions that "encode" different emotions. Hickman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.Third, "The facial expression for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Huang," even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions"(like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in areal face or on the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identity mixed emotions(as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).In conclusion, the use of this technology is very, no extremely important in schools because it can give the teachers and the principles and idea how to get the students to learn better on what is being taught. The technology can also give the teachers and idea of who is bored or tired, or even who is having a bad, or fantastic day.
