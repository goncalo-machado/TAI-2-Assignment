In this article called "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" The author said that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Theres good and bad reasons why studying Venus is good and bad. The bad reasons why going to Venus to study it is the temperature it is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we hate in our own planet. Even if they did go there they would burn to death because on how hot it is. It could crush and even liquefy the metals of a submarine if they go down deep in some parts of the ocean. In the article it said that we can see it from earth because on how close it is, and its the same size of our own planet.The good reasons for studying Venus is that what has it been doing, has anything happened? Scientist has asked these3 questions, and we still dont know the answers to them. They said that the planet which is Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features that are analogous to those who are on earth. The planet has rocky surfaces, has some Talleys, and some mountains in it too and also craters. The way scientist experiment Venus is by putting a ship in the sky from a good distant that nothing can happen to it is shows the whole planet with cameras that show the ground and the conditions on what is going on.NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus we dont know what it is yet, but we will know later on. Overall I think its a good idea to study Venus not just that specific planet, but other ones like Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn all of those planets they should be studying here and there. I wonder what they look like from the ship that they hate put in space. Studying the planets would be good but sometimes dangers because of how hot it is and how cold it is. The author has written this perfectly he tells us in detail the good and bad reasons why studying Venus is important.
