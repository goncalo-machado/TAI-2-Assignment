I partially disagree with the statement that " it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts". I agree that students should be taught facts, but I do not think that facts are the most important part of a students education. Students need to be exposed to a wide variety of ideas, concepts, and information in order to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. In my opinion, the best way to do this is to teach students how to think critically and to use their own reasoning skills to solve problems. I believe that a good teacher can help students develop these skills by providing them with an environment in which they can do so. For example, if a teacher gives students the opportunity to write a paper on a topic that they are interested in, they will be more likely to engage in the process of thinking critically about the topic. If the teacher does not provide students with this opportunity, then the students will not be able to critically think about their topic and will instead rely on other sources of information, such as the internet, television, or other media, to find answers to their questions. This is not to say that teachers should not give students opportunities to express their thoughts and opinions in class. However, I feel that these opportunities should only be used when students are not already engaged in a discussion about a particular topic or when they have not yet developed the ability to analyze and evaluate the ideas presented to them.What is your opinion on the concept of "critical thinking" and how it can be applied to the classroom? I am not a big fan of the term "Critical Thinking". Itseems to imply that there is a set of rules that must be followed, rather than allowing the student to make up his or her own rules based on what he or she thinks is important. It also implies that one must have a certain level of intelligence and knowledge to participate in this type of discussion. As a result, many students who are good at thinking are discouraged from participating in these types of discussions because they feel like they dont have anything to contribute. On the other hand, some students, especially those who have been raised in an intellectual environment, may not feel comfortable expressing their ideas in such a way that others can understand
