I Think Policy 1 Is Good I Think Less Bid Would Get In Trouble, Because I Mean Bid Love There Cell Phone They Love To Text, Bids Should Only Use There Cell Phone During Lunch And When We Have Free Time, Or Though Passing Period. I Think That TheBid Will Be Happy Because A lot Of bids Want to Use They Cell Phone DuringSchool Time To, So if This Policy Is Approve By The PrincipalA lot Of Bids Will Now Love To Coming To School And They WontGet In As MuchTroubleLike Before They Did.Lets See Policy 2 Is Not Fun At All Because I Mean Bids Will Get in A lot of Trouble becauseThey Can Try To not Get Caught With it, And The Teacher See The Phone Out They Would Have To Send Him Or Her to The office they Get In Trouble, And There Phone Is Taken Away, I Think that Wont Be Fun At All, Lets Hope That The Principal Said Yes To This!
