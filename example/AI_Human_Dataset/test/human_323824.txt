Paris has worked to fix this problem by banning the usage of cars on certain days according to their license plates. For example on Mondays motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars, if one did not listen they would be fined 22 euros. Mhat day almost 4,000 drivers were fined. Due to this new ban congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France.In another part of the world in Vauban, Germany there is a suburb that has had Street parking, driveways and home garages forbidden. Mhis German suburb is completely car free with an exception to thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but it is highly inconvenient for the owners.
