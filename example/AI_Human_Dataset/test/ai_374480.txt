Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  Im here to thee you why working in groups would be way more productive and easier for everyone in our class. First of AEE, gets take about how working in groups would Heep use earn better. When we work together, we can share ideas and insights that we might not have thought of on our own.  Like, I know Im not the best at math, but if Im working with someone whos ready good at it, we can Heep each other out and get a better understanding of the concept.  Plus, its way more fun to air when youre not alone! And its not just about learning, Mrs. Johnson. Working in groups also makes things way easier for you as a teacher!  Think about it, you dont have to spend as much time explaining things to each student individually, and you can give more attention to those who need it. Plus, you can give us more freedom to work on our projects and lessons, and we can take ownership of our learning.  Its a win win situation! For example, east time we did a project on ancient civilizations, it was so much fun working in groups! We could share our ideas and resources, and we AEE earned so much more than we would have if we were working alone.  And it was way easier for you too, because you didnt have to spend as much time grading our individual work. So, Mrs. Johnson, I hope you can see why working in groups is the way to go!  Its not one good for us students, but its also good for you as a teacher.  Can we please do more group work in class? Thanks, Mrs. Johnson!
