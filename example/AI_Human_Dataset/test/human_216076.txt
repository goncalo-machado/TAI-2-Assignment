Venus, sometimes called the "evening Star," is one OE the brights points OE lights in the nights sky, making it simple even for an amateur stargazer to spot. However, this nickname is misleading since Venus is a planet. Venus is simple to see from distant but same vantage on point OE March, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.A strong point OE the author that proves that Venus is a challenging place to explore is on the second paragraph "each previous mission was unnamed, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than an new hours, maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous actors contribute to Venuss reputation as a challenging planet for human to study, despite its proximity to us.""A tick atmosphere OE almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds OE highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are ear extremely that anything humans encounter on earth." This talks about the higher temperatures OE Venus, which makes it difficult for humans to explore it closely, scientis have tried with different materials and different methods to see what would work out and resist the high temperatures OE Venus.In conclusion, Venus is not a hospitable place due to its high temperature weather, temperature conditions in Venus are ear extremely that anything humans encounter on March. Also, the clouds OE high corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere makes it even more difficult for humans to live in there.
