Sports?Should the principal takeaway sports for people who have a C average? I think that you should only take sports away for kids with a D average. You should give the kids who are passing school the ones with the privileges. Kids with Cs could be trying really hard to pass and maybe thats the best they can do. I believe that kids who are passing school should get do to do things that they enjoy because they work hard at school and should get some kind of reward. I think kids with a D average need to try and work harder for what they want.Although all kids do enjoy sports I think kids at school should have a passing grade to participate in after school activities. For example if a child has a AB average those children should be able to have there choice first, then the kids with C average could see what sports are left and pick.Even though all kids should get do to sport its a matter of ho is can do sports and juggle a sort. Ehere are some kids who cant handle school so i didnt think that if they cant handle school they cant handle school and a sport. To be on a sport stem]am you have to be able pass school as well.So as you can see I think that in order for the principal to take away sports she should only take sports away from the kids who are not doing homework and passing school, and the kids who are doing good in school should get the first pick of what sports that they want.
