The electoral collage should be disbanded. Not only is it unfair to minority party voters, but it also is unreliable.The electoral collage consists of people voting for an elector, which in turn votes for a president. This may sound like a good idea, but in reality, it overcomplicated and scrambles things. This has lead to a less wanted candidate able to win the election. During 2000, presidential candidate Al Gore relieved the popular vote, but not the presidency, due to the process of voting for the electors, rather than the presidents. This led to Al Gore relieving 266 electoral votes, and George W. Bush winning 271, therefore electing a less popular president. Not only that, but the electors being voted for may not even vote for the candidate they say they will.The winnertakesall strategy was placed to reduce the change of ties and have the candidates focus on taking over the swing state votes, but an unintended consequence was the reduction of voting from minor party votes, for example, when a Democrat in Texas or a Republican in New York votes, they hardly get any say, and therefore may stop voting. A popular vote for presidency would alleviate this problem and make it able for anyone from a state to have an equal voice in the state.Popular vote would lead to members of different states having the same amount of power, while the electoral collage leads to unequal representation. Because of the Senates two representatives per state, people in less populous states have more power. For example, California has 2 Senate representatives and 35 million voters, and Wyoming, with a much smaller population, has the same amount of representatives in the Senate, leading to a Wyoming resident having much more than a Californian one.All in all, the electoral collage is a bad idea. Not only does it ensure inequality, but it also leads to inaccurate voting and discrimination against a voter who votes for a minority statewide candidate. To truly be fair to all voters, the popular vote method should be implemented to resolve all the problems.
