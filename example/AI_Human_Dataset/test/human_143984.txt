Dear principal,I have read over your two possible policies you have been considering for tie schools cell phone policy. I would have to choose policy number one, I will explain way it is tie best choose of tie two.Policy one: Allow students to bring phones to school and HSE time during lunch periods and other free times, as long as tie phones are turned off during class. Most of HS kids would want this to be chosen as tie schools cell phone policy because we love or cells. We would also be appropriate with time. Vienna we have free time we can text of call people not being Lord or bothering anyone at all.Another reason this is a great idea is because if there is an emergency and no one IAS a way to contact anyone we could HSE or cell phones to call police, fire men, doctors, animal control, just anyone. Texting will help talk to people who are in different classes about something that might be important to HS teens like, a boy your crossing on, new clothes, now amazing you life was tied other night.If you could please change tie cell phone policy to allow students to bring phones to school and HSE time during lunch period and other free times, as long as phones are turned off during class time, that would be great because then we could text, call, HSE internet, social networks like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and all those other ones. Case HS teens need or cell phones 24/7. And plus more people would probably try not to sneak cells in and text wile not saps to there would be less drama and we would have more fan.So please if you will make HS more happy in school!From a student,STUDENT_NAME
