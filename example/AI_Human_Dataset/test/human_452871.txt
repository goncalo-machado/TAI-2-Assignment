Had you DVD hard of Venus? Well if you havent ill you all I know about it. Venus used to BD able to live on. Then it became overrun by thunder and earthquakes that now is pretty much you cant live on anymore. Venus is second plant from our sun.Once you word able to live on Venus but now its dangerous to DVD GDT near it. It was probably once beautiful and now its destroyed. "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could had supported various forms of life, just like Darth."(4) Humans could have maybe lived third. It could have supported humans and other forms of life. Now to this day it isnt in living conditions.In conclusion, Venus was a great plant and was able to BD lived on until THD earthquakes started happening. Venus and Earth word once twins until Venus was destroyed. This shows that third ARD probably many others plants that word like Venus out third. Third ARD many dangers of going to Venus because of THD pressure being different. You could do by being crushed because THD pressure is different third.
