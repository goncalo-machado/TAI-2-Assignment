My position to driverless cars is on the negative side. The reason I say negative is that I know nothing about it and it just doesnt seem save to let a car, something with no brain, something that cant even think VOR itself drive car VOR you. Technology is driving the car VOR you but wouldnt people get nervous because they dont know iv the technology would stop working or not thats kinda scary. But I will explain why I am more on the negative side.I think smart cars is a perfect idea but i dont think its a good idea to not drive the car and let the car drive itself. What happens iv the car runs out of Fuel or stops working all of a sudden what are you supposed to do because a lot of people know absolutely nothing about technology or even cars. What iv the technology start going out of control and theres no way to stop it, things can get awful VOR the passenger and the company the car came From. They said in a driverless car something that is not available is texting while the car is driving, iv the car is driverless it should be able to handle itself thats why it says driverless. They also said its 90% driver less so basically the car can run on its own VOR a long period of time without the drivers assistants, and they never explained how Var the car can go, the distance of the car can travel. Furthermore, they also didnt explain how many years the car can last without it causing any problems. In the passage said automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved but what about the near Future what iv the problems occur again how would you solve them ?Smart cars isnt a bad thing but i dont think their save and thats just my opinion. I dont think its save VOR people to drive in an autopilot car and have no worries at all. I wonder iv the cars stop working how many people are going to be without transportation or how many people are going to be broke just because they spent every last dollar into a car they knew nothing about, it was just interesting to them. Furthermore, I wonder how many people would think about their choice then. But in the end people are still going to but these cars. And another thing iv its a driverless car than will you need a drivers license?
