My principal recently decided that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, and I totally agree. I think every student should participate in an activity like sports, a musical in s argument class, or some sort of club. This would help students to learn and develop talents and skills. Also, it would Five students a time to socialize with people. So, I think the principals idea was Area, and it helps students learn and Grow and Gives time to socialize.If students do after schools activities like sports they will be able to exercise and practice coordination with friends. Sports will make students too Arow to strong and AET lots of sunlight. Learning an instrument has been proven to make people smarter. But not just in music, in other curriculum too. Also, there are a lot of different clubs out there that can help people with Bettina jobs or just learn a hobby too.One BIA China that I will really like about this is that it Gives students more time to socialize with friends. This will also Five practice of BIA social skills you will use through your life. This skill will help AET jobs for students later in their life. With an extra hour or two to spend time with peers and teachers they will AET a lot of practice. But most of all Five students a fun time after spending all their day at school.So in conclusion, the principals decision on students participating in extracurricular activities would Good for me and my peers. It will Five students time to develop and Grow their skills, like coordination, knowledge of a topic or hobbies. Also, it would Five students time to socialize, Grow social skills and have fun. So in the end the principals decision is Area.
