Working alone is more beneficial than working with a group. People can work relax and calm without being interrupted, and no one has to ask other people opinion, and also people are shy, they might dont like being surrounded by other people. On the other hand, working with a group can be good, because everyone can share ideas. However, working alone is much better.Work is already stressful, and work with people talking and giving opinion about the job is worse. Imagine a work where the whole group is speaking and there is someone stressed, this person wont be able to work relax and think about new ideas, probably when the person get home, it will be more stressed than someone who worked alone and quiet. Being alone make any person relax, and once youre relaxed no one can stop it, the ideas come to your mind.During doing the work, might suddenly appear a new brilliant idea, and with a group the proposal is checked with them and see if everyone agrees, and it spends time, and also might happen that not everyone agreed. Working alone can gain time, because people can use the time theyre asking the group to work more instead of asking someone opinion. Also, it creates discussion, more and more people speaking at the same time, disagreements and agreements, wasting time, and making people confused. Then it is better work alone to gain time working instead of asking, everyone does your own work.Being surrounded by a lot of people might be hard for shy people. For example, Im shy, and work in group for me is a struggle, have to talk to other person, have to share my ideas, I cant do my work relax, I cant either think about anything. The impression caused is that people will look at your work and judge it, and wont agree, and there Im, needing to do everything again, in most of the time I dont even show my own work I just agree with other people work. It is not good, the brain doesnt work how it was supposed to work, people looking and may judging, all of it might collaborate for a terrible work.Some people might say that work together people could share ideas and open the door to new opportunities, of course share ideas is a good point, see every point of view. However, working alone has much more benefits, is better to have a good time working, without stress than share ideas and get home stressed and fall of everything.Working alone in a peaceful place, just you and your thoughts, to think about everything, every point, to analyze all things, relax and calm, whiteout being shy or stressed. It is the benefits that everyone needs to have.
