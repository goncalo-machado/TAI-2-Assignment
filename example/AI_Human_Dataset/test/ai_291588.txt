[Your Name][Your Address][City, State, Zip Code][Email Address][Phone Number][sate][Senators Name][Senators Address][City, State, Zip Code]sear Senator [Senators last Name],I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and advocate for its continuation in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue for changing to a system based on the popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several essential benefits that should be considered.Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Poster, the winning candidates share of the electoral vote consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the Electoral College system minimizes the chances of a dispute over the outcome of the election, as was seen in the 2000 presidential election. With the winnertakeall system in each state, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral vote victory. Although a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely.Moreover, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have transregional appeal. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, promoting candidates to seek support across different regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and ensures that the interests of all regions are represented. It is important that the president be viewed as "everyones president," which the Electoral College system helps to achieve.Additionally, the winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes in the Electoral College leads to candidates focusing their campaign efforts on swing states. This is beneficial as it encourages voters in these states to pay close attention to the campaign and to the competing candidates. Swing state voters are likely to be more thoughtful and informed voters due to the increased attention they receive from candidates. These voters should have a significant influence on deciding the election.Furthermore, the Electoral College restores some balance in the political power of large states compared to smaller states. As Judge Poster highlights, the Electoral College compensates for the apportionment of the Senate and ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This helps to ensure that presidential candidates do not solely focus on the needs and concerns of smaller states to the detriment of larger states.Iastly, the Electoral College system avoids the complexities of runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This eliminates the need for additional elections and simplifies the presidential election process. It allows the nation to come together and support the elected president without further delays or uncertainties.In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty of outcome, ensures that the president is everyones president, encourages focus on swing states, balances the power of large and small states, and avoids the complications of runoff elections. Based on these benefits, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained in the election of the President of the United States. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College in your decision making process.Sincerely,[Your Name]
