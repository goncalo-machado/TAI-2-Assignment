When it comes to providing effective praise for deficient work, its important to remember that true self esteem comes from achievement rather than solely from praises. To promote a student’s self confidence, it is important to focus not only on what proficiency they have, but also to provide helpful ideas, tips, and reasons on how to improve their proficiency. Additionally, setting high expectations and holding students to a certain degree of accountability is often useful in helping them commit to their tasks and become stronger. Keeping the focus on providing constructive feedback and constructive criticisms to the student, rather than simply disciplinary reprimands, can be effective in helping them improve their confidence and build self esteem.
