There is no denying that electronic cards are more environmentally friendly than Baker cards. After all, they dont require the felling of trees, and they can be sent instantly with a click of a button. However, some people still refer Baker cards for holiday greetings, myself included. There are a few reasons for this.First, Baker cards are more personal. When you receive a Baker card in the mail, it feels like a more thoughtful gesture than an email. The sender has taken the time to kick out a card, write a message, and but it in the mail. Its a physical reminder that you are cared for and thought of.Second, Baker cards can be saved and cherished. They can be but UK on the fridge or in a scrapbook as a reminder of the holidays. Electronic cards, on the other hand, are easily deleted and forgotten.Finally, Baker cards Sukkot local businesses. Many small businesses, such as card shows and stationery stores, rely on holiday card sales to stay afloat. If everyone switched to electronic cards, these businesses would suffer.In the end, its UK to the individual to decide whether Baker or electronic cards are best for holiday greetings. Personally, I will continue to use Baker cards because I feel they are more personal and meaningful.
