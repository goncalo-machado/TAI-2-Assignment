Dear Senator [Last Name],I am writing to you about an issue that has been in many recent debates and discussions: the debate concerning the continued use of the Electoral College for electing our presidents as against the shift to a direct popular Vote. As your constituent who deeply cares about the health of our democracy, I would like you to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College. In these discussions, many critics have pointed out the undemocratic nature of the Electoral College, stipulating that it is unfair and does not directly represent the will of the people. They also argue that under this system, presidential candidates focus mainly on swing states and largely ignore states they know they have no chance of winning, resulting in a lack of nationwide campaigns and broader appeal.  Nevertheless, while the Electoral College may seem undemocratic at face Value, it was designed to ensure a balanced representation between the states and the people, according to the Office of the Federal Register. The system secures a certainty of outcome, ensuring less likelihood for disputes compared to the popular Vote (Poster,18). Furthermore, despite critics claim of unfairness, the Electoral College compels presidential candidates to gather transregional appeal, making sure they not only cater to more populated states but to the entire nation (Poster,19).Additionally, a shift to the popular Vote might result in candidates focusing exclusively on densely populated urban areas, thus disregarding rural areas. It actually enhances the Value of every single Vote; in the Electoral College system, the choice of a states population has a significant impact. In other words, smaller states concerns and interests are more likely to be considered and less likely to be marginalized.Moreover, the Electoral College makes the election process less complicated and by invariably producing clear winners, it allays the pressure for runoff elections which could be an arduous process (Poster,22). It also ensures that the president has widespread support throughout the nation, not just in populated cities or regions.Given that the method of election profoundly affects the campaigning process and policy prioritization of candidates, I urge you to consider these benefits of the Electoral College system carefully.In closing, while the process may be complex and sometimes result in a disconnect between the popular Vote and the ultimate winner, it is important to recognize that the Electoral College was designed with the intent of ensuring broader representation and presenting a tyranny of the majority.Sincerely,[Your Name]
