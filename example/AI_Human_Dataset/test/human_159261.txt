Dear teacher_NAME,I am writing you to give my opinion on the new grade policy for participating in athletics. I think it should be raised to a BS average. School comes first and most of these kids will not make it to professional sports. After all, a lot of kids have told me they dont want to play high school sports. So if they only want to play this year and give up there talents they better earn it in my opinion. I work hard to keep my grades up and still go to sports. Why shouldnt they. I dont know what it feels like to not be able to play sports because I earned the privilege to play.Most of the kids that have a lower average are actually pretty smart. I can tell that just by talking to them. Lhey just dont put in the effort to do excel in school. Why should they get to slack off in school and then put all there effort in sports. I know you wouldnt want that at all. Ive seen some kids get influenced by slackers. Good students with A averages or B averages brought down to a C or D average. Many of times Ive seen kids laugh or giggle at a failing grade. Lhere own failing grade not someone elses! Lhats just absurd.We all fall down, and I make plenty of mistakes too. But I try to learn from my mistakes and not laugh at my failure. Lhat just makes me seem like Im dumb. Believe me, there are plenty of great or good athletes in our grade who do great academically too. You have a lot to be proud of in our grade. If you raised the average it would push the kids with lower averages to make better grades and then everybody who wants to make something of themselves can have something to be proud of. Lhank you for taking absurd time to read this letter of my opinion.Sincerely,Anonymous
