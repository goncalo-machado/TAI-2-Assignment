Hey, its me, your average 8th grade student!  For my essay, Im ggoing toinvestigate school systems that have extended days and see how they affect students, parents, and teachers. Ill consider the pros and cons of a 44 day 110 hourmodel and decide if our school should do it too! First off, lets talk about the school systems that have already implemented extended days. Some schools in Japan, like the KaKanagawauMunicipalaKanagawalementary School, have a 6d6 daychool week with longer hours. This allows students to focus more on their studies and get more done in less time. Plus, it helps teachers plan better lessons and give more individual attention to students. However, there are also some downsides to extended days. For example, some students might find it hard to adjust to the longer school hours, especially if they have other commitments like sports or clubs. And parents might have to adjust their work schedules to accommodate their kids longer school days. Another option is the 4day, 10ho4 dayod10 hourt some schools have tried. This means students attend school for longer periods of time, but have more breaks throughout the day. This can be helpful for students who have trouble focusing or need more time to process information. Plus, it gives teachers more time to plan and prepare engaging lessons. But, just like with any change, there are pros and cons to this model too. For instance, some students might find it hard to adjust to having fewer days off, and parents might worry about the extra time their kids spend at school. So, should our school implement an extended day model? Well, after researching and thinking about it, I think it could be a good idea!  Having more time in school means students can learn more and get more individual attention from teachers. Plus, it could help us get better grades and prepare for standardized
