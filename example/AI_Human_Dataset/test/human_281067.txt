Some schools Have a program that Have older students and younger students. The older students Help the younger students with activities or Homework. But Now will this program Help both the older and younger students? Well, I will be telling you three things Now this program is Helpful for the older students and younger students.First thing is, the younger students will want some Help from the older students because they know more than the younger students, and it would be a great Help. If this program is still going than more and more students will start joining in and they can start forming groups and they can each work on something different.Secondly, this program can be very Helpful by teaching students that are getting poor grades or poor scores on their test theyre getting. Students can even donate binders, books,folders, crayons,pencils, pens,paper, etc. Even the students themselves can start their own fundraiser by making food and can raise money.Lastly, This whole program can be very useful for the community and Helpful for the students. This is way this program is so Helpful and important for us student and adultsIn conclusion the older students Help the younger students with activities Homework/classwork. And that this program is really important to us.
