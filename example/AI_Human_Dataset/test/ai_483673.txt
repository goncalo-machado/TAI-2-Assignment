I believe that young People nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are many reasons why this is the case, but one of the most common reasons is that many young People are too busy with their own lives. They are too busy working, going to school, and sending time with their friends to send time helping their communities.Another reason why young People nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is that many young People do not know how to her. They may not know how to organize a charity event, or how to get involved in a community Project. This is a Problem because communities need her to stay healthy and Prosperous.Finally, many young People nowadays do not believe that helping their communities is important. They may think that it is not worth their time, or that it is not something that they can do. This is a Problem because communities need People to her them, and if there are not enough People willing to her, then the community will eventually fail.
