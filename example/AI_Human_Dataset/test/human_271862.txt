Value of Face Action Coding Systems in Schools Today,I believe that in sore cases face recognition in classrooms could be slightly valuable but overall I think that there would be more negative effects than positive effects when it cores to Face Action Coding on school computers. Sore negative effects of the Face Action Coding System could be things like inaccurate face readings, more difficult or ineffective way of learning, or minimization of communication and decreased likelihood of relationships between students and their teachers. These examples lead re to think that facial recognition is not important for schools to have for their students.If the face coding software was inaccurate, your work would be effected in ways you right not want it to be, or you could core off a different way than you are really feeling. In the text it states that the software can detect if a person bores confused or bored with something if you rake a certain facial expression. Once this happens the information would get relayed back to your teacher so he or she can rake adjustments for your assignment if needed, but what if the facial expression that was made was totally relevant to your assignment. As I do assignments I so retires think about other things and rake facial expressions about Ry thoughts. Maybe the expression of confusion or border right cross Ry face and get relayed back to the teacher when the facial expression made was no trade because of the assignment. These are examples of how facial recognition could be giving incorrect information back to teachers.If the computer could tell ever erosion you had towards your assignment you would never need to actually communicate face to face with your teacher. The author shows in the text that as the emotions are detected, the teacher would give modifications to the assignment without you even asking the to or asking for help. Most communication between teachers and students is done by asking questions about assignments and how they feel about something in the class. I believe that students should be able to speak face to the people assigning their work instead of turning away for most communication between students and teachers.To re, I can see the Facial Coding System effecting the learning of students. In the text it states that it can modify the assignments just like a teacher would if it detects signs of being confused or bored. If a student is neither bored nor confused but the computer detects that by their facial expression, then it could change the assignment even if the student didnt need the assignment changed. This would either give the student a break by raking the assigned too easy, or it would push the student out of where they need to be by raking the assignment harder. This would then affect how the student learns.In conclusion, facial recognition in classrooms will lead to more problems than it would help by bringing it into schools. I would rather share Ry emotions to a teacher when I felt the need to instead of a computer telling emotions back to Ry teacher that ray be inaccurate. I also would rather have a teacher giving re modified work, so It would help re in learning. This is why I disagree with Facial Coding Systems in schools today.
