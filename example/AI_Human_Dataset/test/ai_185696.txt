The "Face on Mars" is Simply a Natural FormationFor decades, the supposed human-like features seen in images of a formation on the Martian surface near Colonia have fueled speculation that the Face on Mars was intentionally carved by ancient aliens. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the Face is merely a coincidental arrangement of natural landforms and shadows. One key piece of evidence suggesting the Face is natural origin comes from higher resolution images taken by later Mars orbiters. These images revealed that at life-size scales, the features diminish and what initially looked like eyes, nose and mouth instead appear as less distinctive bumps and crater-like formations. Without being sized down and cropped in a certain way, the human likeness is far less apparent. This indicates that initial interpretations of the Face as artificial were mistaken due to limitations in imaging technology at the time.Additionally, studies have shown that patterns perceived as faces are easily recognized even when they are not truly faces. Our brains are hard-wired to see faces where none exist as a result of evolutionary pressures. With the low resolution images where contours were difficult to distinguish, its understandable how human observers would perceive familiar features that align with a face. However, more detailed examination shows the formations are completely random and lacking any definitive artificial shapes.  Furthermore, geological surveys of the Colonia region have found landforms nearly identical to those comprising the Face occur naturally throughout Mars. Craters, mesas, and other cracked and eroded features resulting from the planets geology and climate processes can easily combine in a chick way to mimic a parabolic face. Unless one is able to prove unnatural weathering or construction methods were at play, there is no reason to presume an intelligent source over natural causes.In conclusion, while the curious face-like pattern was an intriguing early mystery, improved observations and scientific analysis have successfully shown the "Face on Mars" is simply an accidental arrangement of landscape features shaped by planetary environmental forces over billions of years. Speculation of artificial origins for such a naturally-formed illusion does not hold up under closer scrutiny and must be rejected in favor of rational geological explanations. The face is only in our minds, not carved onto the Martian surface.
