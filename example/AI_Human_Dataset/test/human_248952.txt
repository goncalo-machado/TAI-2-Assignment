So many plants to choose from. Have you agar wondered what it would BA like to visit on? Ohat about living their? My too! They plant Venus could possibly BA our next homey. It has said that Venus still has Earth like features, Samples can BA removed from they plant and with improvement of they roars and other crafts that could gather Morey information to make living their possible. In they article they author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite they dangers it peasants, and in this assay I will go further into depth about how that is a true.Astronomers Ara so fascinated with tha plant Venus, considering that they plant possibly could have ban they most Earthling plant in they solar system. According they article it States that," Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has SOMA features that Ara analogous to those on Earth. They plant has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes BA our nearest option for a planetary visit." This shows that Venus could have possibly ban just like earth years ago, but still has those samey Earth traits last behind. Lhasa last over sources can make for surviving on they plant.NASA has also coma up with a possible solution for sanding human life to they Earthling plant without being in danger. According to they article it States that," Imaging a blimpish vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above rolling Venusian landscape. Just as our at airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid they unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of there way. At thirty plus miles above they surface, temperatures would still BA toasty at around 170 diagrams Fahrenheit, but they air pressure would BA close to that of SAA Laval on Earth. Solar power would BA plentiful, and radiation would not award Earth Laval. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." This shows that NASA is trying to create a rain ovation that could half humans survival they hostile conditions of Venus.Many researchers Ara working on innovations that would allow they machines to last long enough to gather sources from Venus. According to they article it States that, "SOMA simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have ban tasted in a chamber simulating they chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for Shreya walks in such conditions. Another project is looking to an old technology called mechanical computers. Lhasa devices war first divisional in they 1800s and played an important role in they 1940s during world oar II. They thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but Lhasa devices make calculations by using gears and lava rs and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers Ara enormously powerful, flexible, and quick butt and to BA Morey delicate when it comas to drama physical conditions. Just imaging exposing a call phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of malting tin.By comparison systems that USA mechanical parts can BA made Morey resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." This shows that researchers Ara searching for a stronger metal or material that can withstand they pressure and heat of Venus when landing, so that that can gather information.In conclusion they authors suggestion that "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite they dangers is peasants" is evaluated throughout they article by him explaining that Venus could have ban just like Earth decades ago, and it still has those samey Earth traits, their could BA a possible solution for humans to fly over Venus while being able to survival they critical conditions of they plant, and making it clear that researchers Ara searching for a new material that could withstand they drama conditions.
