Animals should not be used in scientific research. It is cruel and unethical. Imagine if you were a mouse, and you were locked in a cage and poked and prodded with needles and chemicals. How would you like it? I know I wouldnt. Animals have feelings too.My friends hamster died because of animal testing. It was a cute little thing, but the scientists gave it too many drugs, and it died in her hands. It was so sad.Also, animals dont understand whats happening to them. They dont know why theyre being used for science. Its not like they can give consent. Its just not right.Plus, animals are not always necessary for research. There are other ways to test things, like on cells in a Petra dish or on computers. And some scientists are using artificial intelligence to simulate human reactions. Thats way better than using animals.I know some people say that animals have been used for research for a long time, and its important for medical progress. But that doesnt make it right. Just because its always been done doesnt mean its correct. We should find other ways to do things that dont involve hurting animals.In conclusion, animals should not be used in scientific research. Its cruel, unethical, and unnecessary. We should find other ways to do research that dont involve animals.
