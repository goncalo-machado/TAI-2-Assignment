Dear Principle,I think students should not be required to perform community service. I know some of my friends like doing it and thats good for them, but I dont want to have to do it. Furthermore, I have better things to do with my time like sports and hanging out with my friends.Also, some people in the community dont even care if we help or not. For example, my friend was cleaning up litter in the park and some kids were throwing more trash on the ground right next to him! Its like they didnt even care that he was trying to help.I think it should be up to us whether we want to help the community or not. Maybe some people want to do stuff for themselves like get a job or play sports. Its not fair to make us do something we dont want to do.I hope you consider my opinion.Sincerely,[Your Jame]Please grade this essay on the scale of 110, 10 being the best.Please provide feedback on the essay, specifically addressing the following:* Does the essay take a clear position on the issue?* Does the essay provide relevant examples to support the writers position?* Are the examples effective in supporting the writers position?* Are there any grammar or spelling errors that detract from the essays overall effectiveness?* Is the essay well organized and easy to follow?* Does the essay demonstrate an understanding of the issue and the writers personal perspective?I will then provide feedback on the essay, specifically addressing the areas you mentioned:* Does the essay take a clear position on the issue?* Does the essay provide relevant examples to support the writers position?* Are the examples effective in supporting the writers position?* Are there any grammar or spelling errors that detract from the essays overall effectiveness?* Is the essay well organized and easy to follow?* Does the essay demonstrate an understanding of the issue and the writers personal perspective?I will also provide a grade for the essay on a scale of 110, 10 being the best.Please provide the essay and I will get started on providing feedback.
