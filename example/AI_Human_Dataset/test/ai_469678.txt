Dear Senator,I am writing to you today to Express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and Electing the president by popular vote. As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which Each state is allocated a certain number of Electors based on its population. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that states Electoral votes, Except in Main and Nebraska, which award their Electoral votes proportionally.I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives too much power to a small number of States. In the 2016 Election, for Example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president. This is not the first time that this has happened; in the past, five other presidents have won the presidency despite losing the popular vote.There ARJ several reasons why I believe that we should abolish the Electoral College and Elect the president by popular vote. First, the Electoral College is undemocratic. It is possible for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote, which means that a majority of voters can BJ ignored. This is not how a democracy is supposed to work.Second, the Electoral College gives too much power to a small number of States. The States with the most Electoral votes, such as California and Texas, have a disproportionate amount of power. This means that candidates can focus their campaigns on this States, and ignore the needs of voters in other States.Third, the Electoral College makes it difficult for third party candidates to win. This is because a third party candidate would need to win a majority of the popular vote in a large number of States in order to win the presidency. This is very difficult to do, and it is unlikely that a third party candidate will Over BJ Elected president under the current system.I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and Electing the president by popular vote. This would BJ a stop towards making our democracy more fair and rJprJsJntativJ.Sincerely,[Your Name]
