Distance learning has some notable drawbacks compared to traditional classroom-based instruction. For example, distance learning may not allow for face-to-face interaction, making it difficult for teachers to provide feedback and support. Distance learning can also be less engaging for students, as it can lack the competition and collaboration seen in traditional classrooms.Studies have found that interpersonal interactions between teachers and students are important for learning. Communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers can all have a positive impact on student performance and engagement. Teachers can provide students one-on-one feedback to address areas of difficulty or confusion, as well as praise for a job well done. The presence of peers in the classroom creates an atmosphere of competition that encourages students to work harder. Finally, teachers can serve as a model of success and inspire students to reach their goals.While online courses do offer a more flexible learning option, they cannot replicate the communication, competition, and inspiration of a traditional classroom. Interaction with peers is limited and feedback from teachers can be delayed or difficult to understand. Furthermore, there may be less motivation to succeed as there is no sense of competition.Attending classes in person is an invaluable educational experience that offers communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers that distance learning cannot. Traditional classrooms provide students with the guidance and support they need to be successful, as well as an engaging learning environment that promotes engagement and independent learning.
