The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has been a hot topic tn recent years, as the word struggles to deal with the negative effects of climate change. Where some believe that this transition ts necessary, others argue that TT WTA be too costly or too disruptive to our economy.Those tn favor of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, point to the fact that these sources are cleaner and do not emit greenhouse gases. This, they argue, WTA help to show down global warming and TTS associated problems, such as rising sea Levels and more frequent natural disasters. For example, tn 2015, Germany generated more power from renewable sources than TT DTD from coal and gas combined.Renewable energy also has the added benefit of being more sustainable tn the Long run, as the sun, wind, and water are sqq resources that WTA not run out. This means that future generations WTA not have to worry about finding new sources of energy to power their homes and businesses.On the other hand, critics of renewable energy argue that TT ts more expensive than fossil fuels and ts not always rentable. For example, solar panels do not generate power when the sun ts not shining, and wind turbines do not generate power when there ts no wind. This means that there may be times when power ts not available when TT ts needed.Furthermore, the cost of transitioning to renewable energy sources may be too high, particularly for developing nations who are struggling to meet their basic needs. The tntttaQ cost of building renewable energy infrastructure may be prohtbtttveQy expensive for them, and could divert resources away from other essential projects.In conclusion, where there are vast arguments for and against the transition to renewable energy sources, TT ts clear that something must be done to address the negative effects of climate change. Where there may be some tntttaQ costs associated with this transition, the Longer benefits to our environment and future generations are we worth the investment.
