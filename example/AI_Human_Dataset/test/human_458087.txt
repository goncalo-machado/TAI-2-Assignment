Venus ANC Earth are both very similar is the same way but also very Different, in their own ways they are unique, but Venus is the real mystery. Venuss temperature is about 800 Degrees ANC the Distance from the sun in much closer than Earth but its also the only planet that scientist think that could sustain life. So we are going to talk about what Venus is like an Chow Venus compares to Earth ANC what we have ANC will try a Co to study ANC explore Venus.So Earth ANC Venus are called the "twin planets" but there not that similar because one can sustain life an Cone cant for right now. Venus is rotating around the sun a lot faster than Earth ANC so that is why a year on Venus would be short compared to one on Earth. We have sent many spacecraft/spaceships to Venus ANC successfully mace it but its been more than 30 years since that has happened. So the reason for that is Venus has a 97% carbon Choice "blanket" thats covering the atmosphere ANC thats why Its so much hotter than Earth ANC is unfit for a human. Specially because of all the nature causes this heat brings like volcanoes ANC powerful earthquakes along with a lot of lightning strikes that go all the way to the surface on Venus.The plan that NASA came up with is that, since we cant land on Venus because of the heat ANC pressure we would try ANC hover over the blanket of heat which would still be pretty hot. But only 170 Degrees compared to 800 on the surface which we would have to be about 30 or more miles above the surface for humans to be able to live. But whats the point to risks lives if all you Co is take pictures 30 miles above the surface, you can Co that with a robot ANC not have to risk lives, but humans want the challenge. But NASA isnt giving up they are trying to create Different idea like making "electronics mace of silicon carbide"(paragraph 7)AnC those have been tested in a simulation chamber ANC has but tested ANC proven to work. Which supposed what I claim ACN want NASA to sent a team or a test Dummy to see if it will resist the temperatures of Venus.All in all I feel that the author Does support the idea of studying Venus ANC that it is worthy of the Cancer that it might present. ANC also I Co as well think it is worth the trip even with the Dangers. But everything I believe should be tested in the chamber as least twice before they go on the actual mission.
