Technology has undoubtedly changed the landscape of our lives in many positive ways. We now have unprecedented access to information and resources. We can communicate faster and easier than ever before, and information is increasingly at our fingertips. However, with this convenience comes a range of potential dangers; technology can have a negative impact on people, disrupting meaningful relationships and conversation, and encouraging people to be careless about important tasks and activities. To mitigate the potential negative effects of technology usage, it is important to make deliberate efforts to establish and maintain meaningful relationships. This can be done by setting boundaries, such as limiting the amount of time people spend on their devices and creating pockets of time during the day when devices are not allowed. Additionally, people should aim for quality over quantity when it comes to conversations. Taking the time to really engage with someone can be far more meaningful than passive scrolling. Finally, it is important to look for opportunities to unplug, such as engaging in outdoor activities or attending events in person with other people.
