The warm sun on my skin and the sounds of nature around me was refreshing. I was so excited about this outdoor adventure with my friends. We decided to take a bike ride around town and see the sights. As we rode, we talked about our goals and accomplishments, and made jokes about the days wed had. We stopped by the local park and sat at the picnic tables, snacking on snacks and taking in the fresh air. Other people were there too, and I was excited to meet new people. We started to play some of our favorite icebreaker games, getting to know each other. By the end of the day, I was filled with a sense of peace and contentment. Taking outdoor activities with friends, family, or by yourself is the best way to enjoy nature and the weather.
