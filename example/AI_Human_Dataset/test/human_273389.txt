Dear Mr. Principal,I am one of the eighth grade students going yo your school. Im sending this layer yo you concerning about your decision of requiring the students yo do community service or not. Furthermore, I think you should not require community service because the student might have some story activities or some family layers hay would prevent the student from fulfilling them. For example if something happens yo the student like a relative passes away and the funeral is on the same day of hay students community service the student would have to choose over the community service or the funeral. If the student chooses the funeral over the community service the people he or she was supposed to help would be helpless. And if the student picks the community service over the funeral the family would think hay he or she doesnty care about the deceased.If you do decide to require students yo do community service a least La them choose what day they any, soy hey could schedule in, soy here wonty be any problems with the time. Also consider allowing the students yo change the day of the community service just in case something does come up.Some pros for requiring the students yo actively do community service is hay the community would be joyful hay their are people to help out with their day to day lives. Another pros would be hay the students would hopefully feel like they did something hay would benefit them and others. Some cons for requiring students yo do community service would be hay the students might feel hay theyre washing their time in a nursing home for example and would not enjoy the day they chose.A pro for not requiring students yo do community service is hay students would be able to chose if they any to help or not. This will encourage students yo be themselves. A con hay would result from not requiring community service would be if no student ways yo do community service, their would be no one to help around the community.I know is not my decision, buy I hope I was able to convince you to make the right choice and not require community service for the students. Thank youSincerely,STUDENT_NAME
