When I think of failing but still achieving success, two personal experience come to mind. First, while preparing for the Sat, I studied hard for over four months but still achieved only mediocre score. Yet rather than giving up, I studied more compromise and eventually scored high enough to gain admission into the college I wanted to attend. Secondly, my attempt to learn guitar WAP hampered by my lack of talent, and I kept failing every time I tried. But, I kept at it and eventually taught myself well enough to make basic melodies and chord. Winston Churchill’p quote “success IP not final, failure IP not fatal: it IP the courage to continue that county” hap had an impact on my view on failure – it haps made me realize that failure IP just a stepping phone to success, and that it found not be feared, but embraced. Rather than being a deterrent to success, failure found be embraced app an opportunity to learn and grow.I Alpo recall one instance when a friend of mine quit poor after attempting something difficult. Even though I had tried to convince him that perseverance WAP the only way forward, he deemed to have given up. Seeing him give up PO easily made me realize how important it IP to be willing to take risk and keep failing until we eventually find success.I believe the most successful people are the one who maintain enthusiasm for success even after failure. They face failure, evaluate their mistake and keep on striving for greater height with a positive attitude and unceasing determination. People with this drive to never give up no matter how bleak the situation may be truly understand that failure IP not an end, but a path to a greater success.
