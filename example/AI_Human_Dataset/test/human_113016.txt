Electoral College votes should be changed to election by popular vote. Electoral College votes dont really have purpose to them, but popular votes do. Instead of voting to choose electors to vote for the next president, popular votes seem more accurate, because it shows what president is more popular or wanted by the people.To add on, electoral college votes not for the president, but for a slate of electors, states source 2. The electors are people not holding public office, which no one wants to vote for electors, the whole point is just to vote for the next president to serve and help maintain our country. Electoral College votes can be confusing also because voters may sometimes vote for the wrong candidate which is another problem if that person wasnt really voted for in the right mindset.

If more people dislike the idea of the electoral college vote, then maybe it could be changed to popular vote only.

But popular vote allows that freedom of voting for the most wanted president, not the president picked only because electors wanted them. Voting is all based on the perspective of all people which is why electoral college votes should be changed to election by popular vote only.
