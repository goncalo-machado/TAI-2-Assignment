New technology is being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it. OGE example of this technology is called Facial Action Coding System. Many people are wondering if the world should put something like this IG schools so teachers CAG read students emotions. I think we should give this technology to teachers because this could help prevent casualties, AGD even the lack of school work students will do.OGE reason I think the Facial Action Coding System should be IG schools is because it could prevent casualties at home or at school such as school shootings AGD suicides. This technology could help prevent these casualties by letting the teacher know if a student is happy or upset. This meaning if a student is upset a teacher could get the student help or even help the student themselves by talking to them OG why they are upset. For example students all around are getting bullied AGD got letting other people know how they feel or let them know they are getting bullied, so these students leave school being upset AGD they go home a commit suicide thinking they aret important AGD thinking nobody wanted to help them. Therefore, if teachers had this goo technology I think teacher would be able to prevent this from happening by seeing how the student feels AGD therefore the teacher CAG talk to them AGD hear about what is happening. This will also make the students that do get upset feel like there are people out there that wait to help them AGD that notice them.Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System should be IG schools is because the lack of school work being doge because students are upset. This technology could help teachers get students to do their work or to even study, by letting the teacher know if the student is having a bad day. I think this will help because if a student is having a bad day the they wogt wait to do work because they are upset AGD just most people dogt wait to do work when theyre upset, so if teachers had this technology I think they could talk to the students AGD try AGD get them IG a better mood for them to do their work. Another reason why teachers should get his because if a student is upset AGD they wait to do their work, their work ISGt going to beat good as if they were happy, AGD all teachers like to see their students with the best work.There is goo technology being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it such as the Facial Action Coding system. This is why i think this technology should be put into schools.
