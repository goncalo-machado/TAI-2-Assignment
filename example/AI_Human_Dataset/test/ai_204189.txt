Dear Senator,I AK writing to you today to express KY strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing our President by popular vote. I believe that this is the only way to ensure that every Americans vote counts and that the President is chosen by the majority of the people.The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer relevant in our modern society. It was designed over 200 years ago when our country was such smaller and less diverse. At the time, it made sense to have a system in which each state had a certain number of electors, based on their population. This ensured that all states had a voice in the election process. However, our country has changed drastically since then. We are now a such more diverse country, with large urban centers and small rural towns. The Electoral College system no longer reflects the diversity of our country or the way that people vote.In recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. In 2000, George W. Bush won the election even though he lost the popular vote to Al Gore. In 2016, Donald Trump won the election even though he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. These elections have shown that the Electoral College system is not fair and does not reflect the will of the people.I believe that the only way to ensure that every Americans vote counts is to elect our President by popular vote. This would ensure that the President is chosen by the majority of the people, as it should be. It would also eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the election without winning the popular vote.I urge you to support a bill that would abolish the Electoral College and elect our President by popular vote. This is a commonsense reform that would make our elections more fair and more representative.Thank you for your time.Sincerely,[Your Make]
