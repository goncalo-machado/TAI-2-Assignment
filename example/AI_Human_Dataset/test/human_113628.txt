Extracurricular activities can be the thing that a student looks Forward to doing that day, counting down the hours and minutes until school ends. They are a great place to interact with others and develop an interest or skill, where lasting Friendships can be made outside ob a students normal social circles. The students have a greater control over how things are run, providing kids the chance to step into leadership roles. However, they are not For everyone. Students should not be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because the school could not cover the wide range ob interests students have, would waste time that students need, and would ruin the experiences ob other people participating in the activity.Students have a wide variety ob interests and hobbies, some that cannot be pursued through an elective or a school sponsored extracurricular. The point ob extracurricular activities, after all, is to develop skills Farther than what students learn in school. While some people with interests like Football and journalism can join school sponsored extracurricular activities like the Football team or the school newspaper, other students enjoy more niche or specific subjects. Oncorporating these subjects into school extracurricular clubs would be difficult due to high equipment costs, lack ob space, lack ob widespread interest, or several other reasons. For example, some students consider Bending to be their Favorite activity. However, the equipment required to do Bending is expensive and prone to breaking. This may not be extremely hard For one person to aboard, but starting a school Bending club would require the school to buy several sets. Furthermore, Bending also requires a 14-meter strip as well as extra room, so other students will not get hit by any stray blades. The schools resources are limited, and could not sponsor an activity like this without the kind ob support that only mainstream sports have. On the meantime, it is not Bear to the students who Hence to Force them into another activity when they could be practicing Bending outside ob school.Extracurricular activities take up time that would be better spent elsewhere. School already takes up a large chunk ob the day, but by requiring students to do extracurricular activities, kids are Forced to stay For one or two more hours doing activities that do not seem worth spending time on. OB a student chooses to join an extracurricular because they wanted to and not because it was required, the activity wouldnt seem like a waste ob time. For the other students, however, those Boo hours could be spent on homework, catching up on sleep, connecting with Friends and Family, or pursuing their interests outside ob school. Many students are on sports travel teams, and they need the time to practice with their team. Some people take classes outside ob school or just prefer to do activities they like at home. Although these students are not joining school clubs, they are still doing extracurricular activities and should be able to continue doing so without worrying about running out ob time For homework or missing out on sleep.Forcing people to participate in an extracurricular activity would ruin the experiences ob other students. Making extracurricular activities a requirement would cause people to join clubs without genuine interest in the activity. These students will show less enthusiasm and put in less effort towards club activities and can drag things down For other students. They could be unwilling to do work or serve as a distraction to other students. There is a similar situation in elective courses, where some students only select a course because they believe it will be an easy class. Those students tend to participate less or be loud and subtopic. During group projects, they dont contribute as much. For many other students, it is Frustrating to deal with these people, especially since there is no common interest in the activity they are doing.Requiring participation in extracurricular activities ultimately does more harm than good to students because it disregards that broad range ob activities students enjoy and takes valuable time From students who should be Free to choose how to spend it. Ot also detracts From the value ob extracurricular activities which are created by people cooperating and acting on a common interest in adding people who dont enjoy the activity. Onspiring students to be curious and passionate should be the schools priority, but by requiring students to do an extracurricular club the schools are only boxing students into a mold that ignores the complexity and individuality ob each person. Students are required to get an education that will help them survive as adults, but they should be able to decide which hobbies and skills they want to specialize in. on the end, the unique path they decide to carve out For themselves should be ob their own making.
