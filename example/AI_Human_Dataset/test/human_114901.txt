THese two articles both shows reasons why we should limit car usage. I know people are going to be like," How am I going to get to work?"," How am I going to do this and that without my car?", but if you sit down and really think about it there are some very good reasons why us fellow citizens should limit our car usage.On paragraph 3 source 1: In German Suburb Life Goes Without Cars, it says" when I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way, a media trainer and mother of two as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles, and he chatters of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor" in this quote it talks about how a mom is going green and starts walking and bicycling instead of driving every day. If you drive everyday you lose a lot of money through out the year spending on gas, car repairs etc. and you pollute the air, nowadays the air that we breathe is getting worse and worse by the years passed, but we could FIJ it if we limit our car usage. With going green and limited driving you could start walking and get good exercise, our world to day not doing so good, and one main reason is because of pollution and obesity. You could knock both of those out by just simply walking to the store instead OD driving and losing gas. Cars are great dont get me wrong, they have been the big impact on our world, but it changed over the years as people started buying cars and gas prices and oil prices are going up, we should all just go green for a while.It will help if you just stop driving one time a week, that will make an impact to our society. I dont think people should be fined for driving a car that they paid for and that is theirs, if you could talk well and a good persuader you could change the mind of the citizens. Hopefully the world changes and goes green a little more very thing helps.
