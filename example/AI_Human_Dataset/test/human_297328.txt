Some people complain that by not having a car they arent allowed to complete certain tasks, or it limits their chances for actually "doing better" in life. If only those people knew how bad having a car could be sometimes. I myself is a person without a car, and I already am stressed out. When having a car you have to deal with the constant prices of gas, the troubles of if your car breaks down or not, and being a reliable taxi as they like to call it for those people who are carefree. I do believe there should be some car limitations enforced.You just read that last sentences of that paragraph and probably thought man this girl is crazy, but no Im serious. There are actually a great amount of advantages for limitations on car usage. For example the constant worrying about gas. How much is it going to cost? Can I afford it this week? Will I make it to work with only half a tank? As stated here "When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way", said Hadron Walter fromIn German Suburb, Lies Goes Without Cars. Think about it this way a giant weight has just been lifted off your shoulders.Being without a car isnt as bad as it may seem. Theres no more having to deposit your life savings when your car breaks down or better yet having to constantly think about that nasty smog that comes out of the back muffler when you need a tuneup.
