While there are certainly pros and cons to this idea, its important to consider the practicality of this idea from the perspectives of the student, parent, and administration. Pros of a four day school week include having more time for students to focus on extracurricular activities, reduced stress by having a longer weekend, and less overall cost for the school district. Cons include increased difficulty for parents to find childcare during the extended school day, potential loss of lessons due to compressed school days, and difficulty for students to keep up with amount of content presented in less time.
