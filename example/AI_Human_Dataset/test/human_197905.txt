The FAE on Mars is just another landform. I think this because there are land forms that form exactly like it on earth, and why would the government let us see pictures of it if it was an artifact from some alien civilization.The face on Mars is just a mess. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." So in fact it is not an artifact of an alien civilization because there are landforms just like it on earth from domes of lava that take the shape of an isolated mesa.If this was an actually conspiracy than why is it not being hidden from us. "Although few sci tests believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Colonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Read Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended." They did not take more pictures because they believed that there was some kind of alien artifact, they took mare pictures because the pictures they had from before were eighteen years old. So things on Mars could have changed during those eighteen years.After all the proving that it was not an alien artifact there were still some skeptics. "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze." Then NASA took more pictures on a clear sunny day and used a really high finalization to show people that if there were pyramids on Mars they would be able to see them in the picture.This just shows to prove that the face on Mars is just in fact a land formation and not an alien artifact. NASA has proved many times again and again that this vestry face is not mare that just a mesa that formed on Mars. Skeptics will keep bring to prove NASA wrong, but there is not another logical explanation than the Face just being a landform on Mars.
