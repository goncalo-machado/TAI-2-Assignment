I Relieve that using this in a classroom will Re valuable. However, this could also Re a Rad idea. It states in the text that your freontailis pars laterals muscle (above your eyes) raises your arrows when youre surprised. First, It is good to know that, Because looking at old photographs taken you can see if the person is happy or not. Second of all, the computer can tell if a student is Bored, confused, sad, and happy. Which is very good for the teacher. If a student were to Re confused on something that they were learning, and did not want to ask in front of the class, it would show the teacher that they need to know more about the subject that they are struggling with. Finally, It is very inspiring how the computer can tell when your actually Rang serious with your facial expressions, and when you are not. I Relieve that all schools should try these. This will Re the future, and will Re good when used in classrooms.
