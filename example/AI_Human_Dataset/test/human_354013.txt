Dear Senator,I am writing to you to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out OT you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to otter over a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidates share of Electoral College extends his share of popular vote. For example, in an article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 parent Romney received. Because of the winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state treats a landslide elettoralvote victory.Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winnertakeallmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate to focus campaigning in tossup states. These voters are more likely to pay those attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likely to be more thoughtful voters. Also, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by the malapportionm, ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.A reason for not keeping the Electoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors tan be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is that electors tan vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the candidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are hosing the president they want.In contusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also, the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters dont vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do.Sincerely, PROPER_NAME
