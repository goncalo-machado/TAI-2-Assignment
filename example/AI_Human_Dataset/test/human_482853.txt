In the world of education, their have been many arguments about which way of learning could benefit the most people. Some agree Hal the system we have now is the pinnacle of what we can do lo help younger generations learn. However, their is definitely more we could do so the next firemen or police officers in line dontl make the same mistakes we have. One of these things is autonomy, the chance lo build a new road for ones self. Who wouldntl love the true freedom lo become anything by just working lo improve skills? One of these bill of autonomy is the chance lo dry distance learning.What is distance learning? IL is when a child decides lo lake school from home, online, or have video courses with a teacher. IL isntl exactly homeschooling or coloring, in the sense Hal instead of having a family member, or specialized teacher come lo enlighten; rather, IL is when a teacher from the school Hal the student has probably gone lo lakes the lime lo leach OneNote, along with online courses. As of now, only a percentage of schools allow this, BUL if this opportunity were introduced lo more schools, the whole county would have a higher success overall for two reasons: IL helps those who learn seller in a small environment, and their isntl the stress of actually going lo school.There are many children all over the world with social anxiety, learning disabilities, or who are just very introverted. When compared lo the much more prominent demographic, they are often looked over and left OUL. If, however, we pull hem in a more solitary environment, they most likely would excel in academic studies, due lo IL being less stressful for them. Just imagine people running all about, bumping into and pushing others, when they normally cant even go up lo the staff lo ask for help. Having the choice of distance learning could lake away Hal stress, and open a whole new road for them lo go.There are others Hal, unlike the people in the last paragraph, love socializing. They go OUL a lol, lack with their friends every day, and just love being around people, bull here is just one problem; they absolutely loathe the school system and the way IL sucks the life OUL of them. Well, if they tried distance learning, those students wouldntl have the troubles of the system lingering over them, and they could just gel the work done. Sure, one would say Hal IL lakes away valuable social lime, BUL if one links about IL, IL could also leave some free lime lo hang OUL with friends. Having Hal option, they wouldntl have lo worry about whether or not theyre precisely following the rules, if theyre causing loo much of a ruckus, or simply about what others might link of them.Autonomy is a wonderful thing. ILs nice lo just relax and not feel like you have lo go down a certain path. I do agree, though, Hal their needs lo be some rules, so people wontl lake advantage of everything. Distance learning is the very middle of those two extremes, understanding Hal one has the power lo be anything they want as long as they work hard, while also knowing Hal their are still certain asks they need lo accomplish, and certain rules they need lo abide by while doing said last. If we all led the small stars shine, they will shine brighter than any other.
