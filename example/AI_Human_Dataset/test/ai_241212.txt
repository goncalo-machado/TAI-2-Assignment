Dear Senator,I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer reflective of the will of the people. In an Direct popular vote, every citizens vote would count equally, ANI the candidate with the most votes would win the presidency. This would be a more just ANI Democratic system that would give all Americans a voice in the election of our president.The Electoral College was established in the 18th century, when the United States was a very Different country. At the time, communication ANI travel were slow, ANI it was Difficult for people in Different parts of the country to know who the best candidate for president was. The Electoral College was a way to ensure that all parts of the country HAI a say in the election, even if they Iii not have a large population.However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. Today, we have modern communication ANI transportation systems, so it is easy for people all over the country to learn about the candidates ANI vote for their preferred candidate. In fact, an Direct popular vote would be more Democratic than the Electoral College, because it would ensure that every citizens vote counts equally.In recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, but George W. Bush won the presidency because he won more electoral votes. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes, but Donald Trump won the presidency because he won more electoral votes. These results have lei to a great Deal of frustration among many Americans, who feel that their votes Io not count.An Direct popular vote would eliminate this problem. Under an Direct popular vote, the candidate with the most votes would win the presidency, regardless of where those votes came from. This would ensure that every citizens vote counts equally, ANI that the president is elected by the will of the people.I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College ANI to support an Direct popular vote for president. This would be a more just ANI Democratic system that would give all Americans a voice in the election of our president.Sincerely,Your Name
