While the idea of cars driving themselves may seem like a futuristic dream come true, there are several limitations and potential drawbacks associated with this technology. After reading the article "Driverless Cars are Coming," I have come to realize that the development of driverless cars is not the best solution for our transportation needs.Firstly, the technology behind driverless cars is still in its infancy. According to the article, these cars are not yet capable of handling complex driving scenarios at higher speeds. They can only function reliably at speeds up to 25 mph, and even then, they require human intervention and constant vigilance. This raises questions about the practicality of driverless cars. If a driver still needs to be actively engaged, are these cars truly driverless?Furthermore, the issue of privacy is a significant concern. To ensure driver engagement, some manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers. This intrusive measure raises serious privacy issues. As a student, I value my privacy, and the thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling. The traditional cars without such surveillance have generally performed well, which questions the necessity of this feature in driverless cars.Moreover, the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are substantial. The vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as smart roads that can communicate with them. The cost of such upgrades would be exorbitantly expensive, and its unclear who would bear these costs. Additionally, the logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting.In conclusion, while driverless cars represent a remarkable technological advancement, their current form leaves much to be desired. The focus should perhaps be on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that doesnt yet align with practical, economic, or privacy-related concerns. As a 10th grader, I believe that the development of driverless cars is not the best solution for our transportation needs. Instead, we should focus on improving the technology we already have to make it more efficient, safe, and accessible to all.
