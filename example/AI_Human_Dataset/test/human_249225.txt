In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Elizabeth Rosenthal says "Green house gas editions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas editions in the country." America barely has any Regulations in Relation to greenhouse gas editions to start with, but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few Regulations and some smart city planning. The benefits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.Another good Season to switch is Riding a bike ox travelling on a train ox bus is much more Relaxing than Rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by Rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging.
