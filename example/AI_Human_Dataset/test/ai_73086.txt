The increasing use of technology in peoples lives has led to a significant limitation of human contact. While technology has brought many benefits, such as improved communication and access to information, it has also had negative effects on peoples health and well-being. In this essay, I will discuss the negative effects of the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology in peoples lives and provide evidence and personal examples to illustrate my points.One of the most significant negative effects of the limitation of human contact due to technology is the impact on peoples mental health. Research has shown that people who spend more time on their devices are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety (Twenge & Campbell, 2018). Additionally, social media use has been linked to increased feelings of loneliness and isolation (Lin, 2016). This is because social media often promotes an idealized version of reality, leading people to feel inadequate and disconnected from others.Another negative effect of the limitation of human contact due to technology is the impact on peoples physical health. Sitting for extended periods in front of a screen can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is linked to a range of health problems, such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (World Health Organization, 2019). Additionally, technology use can also lead to poor sleep quality, which is also linked to a range of health problems (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015).Finally, the limitation of human contact due to technology has led to an increased dependence on technology. People have become so reliant on their devices that they find it difficult to function without them. This dependence can lead to a range of problems, such as addiction and a loss of interpersonal skills. For example, I have a friend who is so addicted to their phone that they cant go more than a few minutes without checking it. This has led to a loss of focus and productivity, as well as a lack of social skills.In conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology in peoples lives has had significant negative effects on their health and well-being. People who spend more time on their devices are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as feelings of loneliness and isolation. Additionally, technology use
