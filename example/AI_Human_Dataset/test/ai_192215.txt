When it comes to mechanics and tech, Im determined to learn as much as I can. Im dedicating myself to a thorough education in car repair and computer tuning for engines, as well as learning the underlying physics and equations that govern them. Im also pushing myself to hone my gaming skills, learning how to be faster and more accurate with the tools Im given - all, so I can be the best I can be.
