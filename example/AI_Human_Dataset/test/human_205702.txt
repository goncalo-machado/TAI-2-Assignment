There are many reasons why I think that the face on Mars just a natural land formation. One reason is that where the face is formed there are other Martian mesas. That is what made the land look like a face and the shadowing was just right, and it makes the eyes, nose and mouth.My second argument is this. After the MGS had taken the first photo of the face they still needed better pictures. So there was a picture taken on April 5, 1998, that was ten times sharper than the original picture. Revealing that the face is a natural landform. There is no connection of aliens to the face. People still did not want to relive it isnt a real face. This brings me to my final argument about the Mars face.My last argument is proof. The MGS got close enough to take a second picture. This time the team used the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Which means that you can see pretty much anything that would be around the face. Things like air plains on the ground, shacks, buildings, pyramids, etc. What the picture actually showed was that the face is a land formation. It showed that the face was an equivalent of a mute or mesa. These are a few reasons why I think that the Mars face is just a land formation.
