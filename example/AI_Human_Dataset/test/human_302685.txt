Driverless cars seem very intriguing to Have in the world. The thought of not Having to drive when you do not feel like it. It would make our world much more luxurious, but it might not be the safest.Machines and computers mess up all the time. They malfunction and Have to be fixed. Us, as Humans, Have a better perception of the world, because we can make our own choices. Computers are programmed to do a certain thing. They do not Have that consciousness to decide right from wrong, and that could provide safety Hazards. Driving is already dangerous with us controlling the car, but with a computer it might be worse. I believe that we should Have computer assistance when we drive.Humans should drive still, but the computer, or car should be their to assist us with driving safely. The computer to Human ratio should be fifty to fifty. Even though this would Helpful, we would Have to consider the expenses. We would Have to add sensors to most cars, which will put a pretty unique debt moneywise. We might even Have to upgrade the roads to Have sensors. This might be worth it though. We will never know until we experience it.
