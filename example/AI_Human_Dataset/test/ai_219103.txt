I agree that the government should spend more money on medical care and education than on building theaters and sports stadiums. For one thing, medical care and education both have direct benefits for a larger number of people in society. Medical care ensures that people have access to quality healthcare, which can help to prevent or treat serious illnesses and diseases. Similarly, education provides people with the opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills that can be used to improve their lives. For example, it can open up job opportunities in the future, or help people become more informed citizens.Furthermore, investing in medical care and education can have positive long term impacts on society. Good healthcare can help reduce mortality rates and improve quality of life, while education can help to reduce poverty and inequality. In contrast, building theaters and sports stadiums generally only offer short term benefits, such as providing entertainment for a limited period of time. Furthermore, a lot of public money is often wasted on these projects due to the large number of costs associated with them, such as construction and maintenance expenses.In conclusion, I believe that the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education over building theaters and sports stadiums. These investments have direct and long term benefits for a larger number of people in society, whereas theaters and stadiums offer only short term advantages and often involve a large amount of waste.
