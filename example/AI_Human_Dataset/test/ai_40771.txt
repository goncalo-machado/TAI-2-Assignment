I think homework is stupid and it sucks. Its like, why do we have to do more work at home when we already did work all day at school? Its not fair. I mean, I get that some people might say it helps us learn and stuff, but I dont think it does. It just makes us stress out and not want to learn.For example, last night I had to do this stupid math homework that took me forever. I was up until like 11 pm doing it and I was so tired. I didnt even understand what I was doing, I was just doing it because I had to. It wasnt like I was learning anything. And then today in class, we had to take a test and I did horrible on it because I was so tired from staying up late doing homework. So, that just proves that homework doesnt help us learn.Another thing is, homework takes up all my free time. I like to play video games and hang out with my friends, but I cant because I have to do homework. Its not fair. We should have more time to do what we want to do, not what teachers want us to do.Also, homework is not always relevant to our lives. Like, Im never going to use calculus in my life, so why do I have to learn it? Its a waste of time. We should be learning things that were actually going to use in our lives, like how to do taxes or how to buy a house. That would be more helpful.In conclusion, homework is a waste of time and its not helpful. We should focus on learning things that are relevant to our lives and not stress ourselves out with unnecessary homework.Please grade my essay and give me feedback.Thank you.
