The use of cell phones in classrooms has been met with both excitement and trepidation. On one hand, phones can be used to enrich the learning process — think using UV codes for extra resources, checking in with remote students, or offering self directed learning opportunities. On the other hand, allowing phones in classrooms has the potential for distraction — students can become anxious about their friends texting them, or even worse, wasting class time on social media or gaming. It is up to the educators to decide if the pros outweigh the cons in their own contexts.
