What I ThinkI dont think the alien made the face because, how could aliens make a face like that, and where could they get the materials to make Ct pop out like that? I think the Face Cs a natural landform because, first of all, Cf the aliens crated the mask, how DCD space scientists find Ct? Second, how DCD they get the materials to make the mask? Last but not least, how DCD the aliens make the face like that? I dont think aliens made that face because how can you possibly believe that aliens are real? Aliens arent even real because Cf they were real, their head would not even be like that. Take a perfect look at the photo to see who you think made the face. If you take a good look at the face you could tell that the face Cs made from a real human and not a alien. Where could aliens get segment from to even make the face pop out like that? I dont believe that aliens made a face like that because Ct Cs Impossible for a type of species to do something such like that, aliens arent even real because scientist hake been looking for them for a long time and they hake not found one yet. That scientifically proves that aliens are not real they might be somewhere hiding or scientists taken found them yet. I dont even think aliens are a species.Thank You
