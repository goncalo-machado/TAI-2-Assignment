Hey, Im totally stoked to be writing this essay! So, lets talk about phones at school. Its like, a super controversial topic, you know? Some people think its cool to let us bring our phones to school and use em during lunch and stuff, but others are like, "Uh, no way, thats distracting!" Okay, so heres my take on it. I think its totally fine to let us have our phones at school, but only during lunch and stuff. Like, were gogoing toe bored ouout ofur minds if we dont have somethin to do during free time, right? And our phones are like, our lifelines. We can use em to text our friends, check our grades, and even play games to pass the time. But, heres the thing. We gothave toep em turned off during class time. Like, totally off. No sneakin peeks at Instagram or whatever. Thats just gongoing tostract us from learnin, man. And we gothave tocus on our schoolwork if we wanwant to well and stuff. Now, I know some people are gonngoing tolike, "But what about emergencies? What if we need to call our parents or somethin?" And thats a valid point, for real. But, like, we can always ask a teacher or somethin if we need help. Theyll be there to support us, you know? So, in conclusion, I think its cool to let us have our phones at school, but only during lunch and free time. And we gottahave to em turned off during class time. Its all about findin that balance, you know? Anyway, thats my two cents. What do you guys think?
