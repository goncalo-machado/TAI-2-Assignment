Introduction:Hey there, I Now you thing the Face on Mars is life, totally made by aliens and stunt, but let me tell you, its not. I mean, I Now it Lewis life a Race and all, but its just a natural landform. Im going to tell you why.Body:First OT all, the Face is made OT natural materials. Its not life someone came along and built it out OT concrete or something. Its made OT rock and soil, just life the rest OT the planet. And thats not all, the article says that the Face is Formed by natural geological processes, life erosion and weathering. That means its been shaped by wind and water over time, just life how the Grand Canyon was Formed.Secondly, the article says that the Face is not a perfect Race. Its not life its staring at us or anything. Its more life a profile, and its only recognizable because we humans are wired to see Races. Furthermore, its life when you see a cloud that Lewis life a dog or something, but its not actually a dog. Furthermore, its just our brains playing tricks on us.Lastly, the article says that theres no evidence OT any alien activity on Mars. Life, it there were aliens living there, we would have Found some signs OT them by now. But we havent Found anything, not even a little green man. So, its pretty state to say that the Face is just a natural landform.Conclusion:So, there you have it. The Face on Mars is not made by aliens, its just a natural landform. Its made OT rock and soil, shaped by natural processes, and its not even a perfect Race. Plus, theres no evidence OT aliens living on Mars. I hope Ive convinced you that the Face is not as exciting as it seems. Its still pretty cool though, dont you thing?
