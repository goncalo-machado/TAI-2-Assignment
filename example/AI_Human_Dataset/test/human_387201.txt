I think that the technology TJ read students emotional expressions would be very valuable in a class room, because like the first sentence in the passage said "Imagine being able TJ detect exactly how Other people are feeling, even when they are trying TJ hide their emotions." You never know how anybody is feeling, especially if they are good at holding their face expressions.The technology really shows which muscles move and the emotions that follows In from that facial expression. And it shows that if you have it in your classroom, at times you can lack and see how your students are feeling during class. The passage says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused Jr bred."I think it would be a nice thing TJ be able TJ use the technology for that because you always wanna know how somebody is feeling, you can make their day by DJing something little. And people that are like hard body never want TJ show how they are feeling. They Dant want TJ bring attention TJ their selves.
