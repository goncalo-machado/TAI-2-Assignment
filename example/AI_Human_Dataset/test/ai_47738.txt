While the technology represents a remarkable advancement, its current form leaves much to be desired.The article highlights several limitations of current driverless car technology. For instance, these cars are not yet capable of handling complex driving scenarios at higher speeds, and they still require human intervention and constant vigilance. This raises questions about their practicality and whether they are truly driverless. Moreover, the focus on driverless cars diverts attention from refining existing technologies that could greatly improve road safety.Furthermore, privacy concerns are a significant issue when it comes to driverless cars. To ensure driver engagement, some manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers, which raises serious privacy concerns. The thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling and could lead to increased stress and distracted driving.The economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are also substantial. The vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as smart roads that can communicate with them, which would be exorbitantly expensive. Additionally, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional, adding to the financial burden.In conclusion, while the idea of driverless cars is intriguing, their current limitations, privacy concerns, and economic burden make them impractical for widespread adoption. Therefore, I argue that refining existing technologies should be our current focus rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that is not yet practical or beneficial to society.
