21711Deal Principal,I think that community service is good for the students as well as out community. The students should be Required to do community service to graduate just not so many hours. I sat this because some students also need to do school work, for example some students might need to study for a big test of they might have a lot of homework to do. Some students would love to help, but they just might not have enough time in there day. For example lets say that I get home from school at three then I finish my homework at four and finish eating and doing my chores at five thirty then I Remember I have a test tomorrow and have to study, I finish studying at six a clock But then I have to take a showed and then walk my dog, so I finish at seven and by then its to dark to do any community service. This is how most kids spend there day at least I do. So you see principal this is why we need to have a limited amount of community service to do. Thank you for Leading this letter and I hope you take what I said in consideration.sincerely,STUDENT_NAME
