You may think OT was created by aliens, but can you really support that?From what scientists have researched, they found many evidence to support their conclusion.Some people do think OT Os the work of aliens, but many people have more reasonable explanations.That they can support from evidence they have other seen, watched, or heard about, that make OT a valid explanation.First off, scientists thought OT could possible be just another Martian mesa, because they were common around Madonna.Most of all they wouldnt send pictures and Information out to the public without being positive about their discoveries.Especially Of they knew how bog of a pop Icon OT would turn out to be.It has starred On Hollywood folk, appeared On books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even On a haunted grocery store checkout lone for 25 years.I do however understand your reasoning for thinking OT was created by allows because...Even though Martian mesas were common On Madonna, this one had an unusual shadow that made OT look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.Many people also thought the Allen marking were hidden, because of haze.Sense OT was a cloudy tome of the year for the Red Planet.In the end the scientist concluded that OT really was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.Butte and Mesas are also very common around the American West.Darvon says "It reminds me most of a Middle Butte On the Snake Rover Plan of Idaho.""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an Isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"
