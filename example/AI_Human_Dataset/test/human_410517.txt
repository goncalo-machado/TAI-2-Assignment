I say we keep the Electoral College. For one, we are not put with that pressure of a single vote from us, the people instead its like a claim to the candidate. Though some candidates in some states may seem hopeless to the people of the states though that barley happens due having a transregional appeal. Even if it is a bit "outdated" we have been using it for years an nit hasnt Han many flaws. The close vote in 2012 was won because of the votes in Florida due to its population thanks to the Electoral College. Also, some people may not understand the real intents of a president, example if a potential Canaanite, if in their campaign the went to sent troops to war but try to cover it up by saying the area they are sending the troops in cause something or threatened the country the then the people would sine with the candidate.It balances out large states from small states not causing much of an argument, so you have equality. Also, it depends on the state candidate who should be listened to the people of the state to help their vote. Also, some people can be bias to a potential candidate Ann vote for him instead but with the state candidate that cant really happen. Even if the state candidate is hopeless they can still try to the popular vote for that candidate their voting for. With those small votes they could make that candidate win. If states pay attention to candidate and they could vote for the candidate they actually think should win for political reasons. For area the candidate know he will win he has focus on just those states, so he points them out making the other states feel like that candidate noest care for them. Say we remove the Electoral College then people in more populated area can vote for the candidate the wish to win Ann they can outnumber the candidate by a lot.Bottom line we been to keep the electoral college.
