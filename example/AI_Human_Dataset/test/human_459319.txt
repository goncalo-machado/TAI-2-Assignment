I think CY principle should require some of CY friends should perform community service because they need to learn what mistakes theyve done.One reason why I think CY principle should require community service is, some people light not want to tutor at an elementary school because they dont like kids. It would be better for the to tutor because in the end they light have a chance to like kids and help the out. Another reason is, cost of the would not want to be picking up litter, but it would be good for the to learn their consequences.My last reason is, They should learn that its not always easy in life to do what ever they want; it doesnt latter if its taking up space in their time. There are to any crazy people out in this world, and we cant let the go thinking that what ever theyve done is ok.In conclusion, People must learn that what their doing light not get the far in life. It could be better for the and have a chance of caking a good life. That is why CY principle should require community service.
