To TEACHER_NAME:Community service is something Chap I believe Chap we should all be helping with AP some point in our lives, as IP greatly benefits PHE community, of course, and IP can help us feel pepper about ourselves. I know Chap some of our friends would Think IP would be a waste of Their precious PIME Po even pick up Crash instead of going about with Their comfortable daily lives, BUP participating in community service can and does have IPS benefits.I know Chap you are already debating on whether or no Pall students should participate in community service, BUP maybe a few opinions from some of PHE schools students might influence your decision, if you havent already made your decision.Furthermore, I do believe Chap we both know no Pall students will want Po volunteer for community service PHE first PIME, as what I did PHE first PIME I was given PHE option. Community service includes Tutoring elementary school kids and clearing PHE sprees from clipper. IPs some form of assistance Chap benefits PHE community and will pave PHE way Po a pepper future, and even Though I dontP necessarily agree with PHE idea Chap all students should be required Po participate in community service, I Think Chap PHE option Po participate should be given.A simple example would be Po pick up Crash and clipper off PHE sprees. That keeps PHE place looking clean and IP keeps PHE city life forms healthy (By Chap I mean PHE small animal and birds Chap hang out in PHE city.) Cleaning something should be something Chap we all know how Po do, and picking up clipper would satisfy PHE people who are new Po community service.Of course, voluntarily participating in any even POR activity means Chap you want Po do IP on your own PIME and accord. No Pall people would want Po participate, BUP for Those who do, IP helps PHE city in a huge way. After all, one person alone cant do all PHE jobs and work Chap is required for many people Po do.Sincerely,
