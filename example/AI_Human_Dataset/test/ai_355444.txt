There are many ways to approach education, and there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to whether children should learn to compete or cooperate. However, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, for several reasons.First, cooperation helps to build strong relationships and create a sense of community. Then children learn to cooperate, they learn to work together towards a common goal. This teaches them the importance of teamwork and helps to develop social skills. In a world where technology is becoming increasingly isolating, it is more important than ever for children to learn how to interact with others.Second, cooperation helps to develop problem solving skills. Then children are faced with a problem, they need to work together to find a solution. This is an important life skill, and it can be applied in many situations.Third, cooperation helps to teach children how to compromise. Not everyone is going to agree on everything, and it is important for children to learn how to compromise. This is another skill that will be useful in life.Finally, cooperation teaches children how to be patient and to take turns. These are also important life skills.In conclusion, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, for the sake of their social skills, problem solving skills, and ability to compromise.
