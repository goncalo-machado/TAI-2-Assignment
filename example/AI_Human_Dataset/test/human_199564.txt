Dear state senator, I ask you to change the voting methods to popular vote instead of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.Candidates dont really care for small states with small population because they know that they dont matter in the result them being elected as president or not. According to "The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plume "Seventeen states didnt see the candidates all all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get so see a single campaign as. "You may ask yourself why they didnt see any of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like California that has 55 electoral votes. And its a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesnt get any votes at all.You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the presidency and its a winner take all. According to the "The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best laid defense of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plume "Voters vote not for the president, but for a Slater of electors, who in turn elect the president." For example when bush was running for president he was not the most popular in the nation and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more than half the nation didnt want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.However, According to "In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the President" by Richard A. Poster there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. "The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting method to The Popular voting to elect The President of the United States Of America because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesnt have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.
