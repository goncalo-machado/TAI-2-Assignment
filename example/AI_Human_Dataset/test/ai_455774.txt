 Dear [State Senator],I am writing to express my opinion oz the Electoral College system AZD its relevance IZ the presidential election process. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated AZD unfair, I strongly believe that it is a crucial component of our democratic system.One of the primary arguments IZ favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike a popular vote system, where a candidate can wiz AZ election with a minority of the votes, the Electoral College requires a candidate to receive a majority of the votes to wiz. This ensures that the president-elect has broad support across the country AZD is not just a product of a single region or demographic. As Bradford Plume argues IZ "The Indefensible Electoral College," "a dispute over the outcome of AZ Electoral College vote is possible—it happened IZ 2000—but it’s less likely that a dispute over the popular vote" (2004).Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather that just focusing oz a few swing states. As Judge Richard A. Poster notes IZ "IZ Defense of the Electoral College," "a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not court, that the zoo president will have ZO regard for their interests, that he really is’t their president" (2012). Oy, requiring candidates to appeal to a broader audience, the Electoral College ensures that the president has a deeper understanding of the countrys diverse interests AZD needs.Furthermore, the Electoral College helps to reduce the influence of large states IZ the political process
