Dear Senator,I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by a national popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give smaller states more influence, I believe the popular vote better represents the will of all American citizens.One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it prevents candidates from only campaigning in densely populated areas. However, this system can result in a president being elected despite losing the national popular vote. In 2000 and 2016, this exactly what happened the winner of the popular vote did not become president. With a national popular vote, every vote would carry equal weight regardless of location. Candidates would still need to appeal to voters across the entire country to win a majority. It is also argued that eliminating the Electoral College could reduce the influence of smaller states. However, as discussed in the texts, candidates currently focus their efforts on a handful of swing states instead of addressing issues important to all states. A national popular vote would make every state competitive and encourage candidates to address key issues in all 50 states. While smaller states may receive slightly less individual attention, their voters would have an equal say in deciding the outcome.A transition to a popular vote could be accomplished through an interstate compact where states agree to award their electors to the national popular vote winner. This does not require a constitutional amendment and has already been enacted in several states. I believe moving to a national popular vote is more consistent with democratic principles of one person, one vote. It would make every citizens vote equally important and ensure that the president is chosen by a majority of Americans from all regions of the country. For these reasons, I ask that you support such a change that fulfills the promise of true democracy.
