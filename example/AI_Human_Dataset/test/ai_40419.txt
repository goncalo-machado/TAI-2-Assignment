The legalization of marijuana is a really big deal these days. Some peoples think its a good idea, but others dont. I think its a bad idea.First of all, marijuana is a drug. And drugs are bad for you. They can make you addicted and mess up your brain. My friends older brother got addicted to drugs and now hes in jail. So, if we legalize marijuana, more people will start using it and get addicted. Thats not good.Secondly, marijuana impairs your judgment. If youre high, you might do things you wouldnt normally do. Like drive recklessly or get into fights. Thats dangerous for you and others around you.Thirdly, legalizing marijuana will send the wrong message to young people. Its like saying, "Hey, its okay to use drugs." And thats not a good message to send. Kids are already doing drugs, we dont need to make it easier for them.Finally, there are other ways to deal with pain and stress. My mom uses yoga and meditation to relax. My dad uses exercise. There are lots of healthy ways to cope with stress and pain. We dont need to use drugs.In conclusion, legalizing marijuana is not a good idea. Its a drug, it impairs your judgment, it sends the wrong message to young people, and there are other ways to deal with pain and stress. So, we should just stick with the laws we have now and keep marijuana illegal.Please grade this essay and provide feedback.
