Dear Senator,I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that the president is chosen by the majority of the people, and that every vote counts.FHE Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. FHE candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that states electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. This means that it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote nationwide but lose the election because they did not win enough electoral votes. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016.I believe that this system is unfair and undemocratic. It gives more power to voters in small states than to voters in large states. For example, a vote in Wyoming is worth 3.6 times as much as a vote in California. This is because Wyoming has only one electoral vote for every 198,000 people, while California has one electoral vote for every 710,000 people.I also believe that the Electoral College discourages voter participation. Voters in states that are considered to be "safe" for one party or the other often feel like their vote doesnt matter. For example, in 2016, only 44.2% of eligible voters in California voted, compared to 54.4% of eligible voters in Texas.I believe that electing the president by popular vote would be fairer, more democratic, and would encourage more voter participation. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College.Frank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,[Your Name]
