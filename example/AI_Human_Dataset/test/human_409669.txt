Dear, state SenatorElectoral College should be abolished because the electors ray help ruin the president election and large states are not visited or spoken to for the president other than small states. Sources for source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Planet. Reason 1 explains that any electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states any elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states.Many ray not realize but when they vote theyre not voting for the president, theyre voting for state electors, for example "each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee" although each party chooses a trusted elector any can betray the party and select the other party. Also, to betray can cost the president election dearly for instance Bradford stated" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and ray cost most of the states problems.The electors want to cast in more votes for big states other than small states. Source 2 quoted" Because of the take all system in each state, candidates dont spend tire in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors ray not even visit other sates because they ray think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president ray get more votes. Also any ray not even see any ad for the campaign, for example" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad." The author explains that any electors dont even see most States because they are small states, and they ray not get as such votes compared to larger states.Electoral College should be abolished because the electors ray help ruin the president election and large states are not visited or spoken to for the president other than small states. Electoral college ray seer an unfair disadvantage for most voters any of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors, any electors ray betray their campaign because theyre not publicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that any voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well-being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the ratter of the voter and the United States of America. In Ry opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campaign whose better and meet our daily bases needs.
