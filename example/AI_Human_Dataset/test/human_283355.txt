In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" a Nick DAlto we can see different studies such as the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois and experts like Prof. Thomas Human and Dr. Paul Beckman are saying that a computer software "Facial Action Coding System" can recognize emotions, the process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face with all the 44 major muscles they had classified 6 basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust fear and sadness."The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"Dr. Huang observes, In my opinion computers should not learn or know how to read your emotions even thought it could help in a classroom a recognizing when a student is becoming confused or aired, I dont think every single human expressions of all emotions are the same, in the introduction of this article we can read that the "New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other" AUT how accurate can it eye? For example when youre not making any face expressions or when youre not feeling any of those 6 expressions listed what is the computer going to say, In paragraph 7 and 8 we can see how the computers "can indicate the difference between a genuine smiled and a forced one" this is possible a using the Zygotic major muscles AUT what about when youre making a forced sad face can the computer recognize that too?Aecause it doesnt really clarify in the article. Other reason why I think computers should not eye male to read or recognized your emotions is because even if it does help teachers and advertisers see what the other people are feeling I dont think it would eye very useful.In conclusion the software Facial Action System should not know how to recognize what youre feeling because is not very useful, and it doesnt say how accurate it is also not every single human express their feelings, emotions or face expressions the same furthermore I think it is useful for some people AUT not everyone would like a computer to tell them what theyre feeling.
