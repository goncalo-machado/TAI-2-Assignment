Driverless cars are obviously cars without drivers. Many have envisioned such an idea as revolutionary as Sergey Brin. As a matter of fact google has built such cars since 2009. However, some people see this as a flawed idea and see this as a bad thing. Im honestly split about each side.Driverless cars do have a lot of positives. Lhey are ecological friendly, so they save both gas and money. Also, they are way more flexible than a bus could be, since it can go anywhere. Not to mention they are way safer than normal vehicles, alerting people who are distracted by anything while on the road. Speaking of safety, that seems to be a major area that is addressed. For instance, when there is a problem the car would state it and giver the passenger the option to take over. Another way is the cars expensive sensors that detect when theres going to be a problem, and automatic breaks the car to avoid any damage.However, there are some glaring issues that must be addressed. First off people will get bored because they are passengers. Plus being alarmed of this every time your dozing off, by the car itself, isnt going to help anyone, just annoy them. On top of this driving cars is a rite of passage into adulthood. Laking that freedom away is just wrong. Not to mention, whos to claim in an accident involving two of these things from different companies. Its stated in the paragraph that new laws must be made for these kinds of cases, and that could take years.In conclusion, Im split about this idea. Driverless cars might be the next evolution for the motor companies, but it is flawed in some rather serious degrees.
