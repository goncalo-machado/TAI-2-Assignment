Dear: Principal I think we shouldnt do community service. We have other stuff to do. We do not mike to do community service. If we do that we dont have time to do other stuff. I think community service is too much for us. I other people should do it. Like high school students should do community service. I think not elementary school do that because we are not ream my to do that. We are not fun to do community service. I think for high school students would it has been better to do that. They are old to be doing that. They would mean better than elementary school. I think high school are better than elementary school. So I think you should make high school students do it. But it up to you principal if you want elementary school to do community service, or you want high school students but think high school is better. They would mean nice and pretty.
