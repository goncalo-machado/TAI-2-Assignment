I believe that meditation and mindfulness practices should be included in schools because it can help students in many ways. Firstly, it can help students reduce their stress and anxiety levels. In todays fast paced world, students are under a lot of pressure to perform well in academics, sports, and other extracurricular activities. This stress and pressure can lead to anxiety and depression. Meditation and mindfulness practices can help students to relax and calm their minds, which can reduce their stress levels.Secondly, meditation and mindfulness practices can improve students focus and concentration. With so many distractions around them, its hard for students to stay focused on their studies. By practicing meditation and mindfulness, students can learn to control their thoughts and stay focused on their tasks. This can improve their academic performance and help them to achieve their goals.Thirdly, meditation and mindfulness practices can help students develop empathy and kindness towards others. In a world where people are becoming more self centered, its important for students to learn the value of empathy and kindness. Through meditation and mindfulness practices, students can learn to be more aware of their own emotions and the emotions of others. This can help them to develop better relationships with their classmates and teachers.In conclusion, I strongly believe that schools should include meditation and mindfulness practices in their curriculum. It can help students reduce their stress levels, improve their focus and concentration, and develop empathy and kindness towards others. These benefits can help students become more successful in their academic and personal lives.
