Since the 1950s everyones dream was to hale a nice car, but it is coming to a point in time when the car culture is coming to an end. You might be thinking that this is horrible and how will I get places without a car. No, its not horrible at all, its actually very beneficial in other ways. It can help people become free, less dependent, and it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases tremendously.The first reason that limiting car use is a good thing is that it can help people become free and less dependent. It has caused people to not always be in a hurry and made them less stressed. In Bogotá, Colombia they had a carefree day when people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. People felt so free, and they felt they were doing a good deed, so some got rid of their cars for good. Cars are becoming less popular in the world as we speak. For example from 2005 to 2013 the number of miles driven in the U.S.has reduced by 9%, which is equal to where the country was in 1995. Another example is that a study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. Also shopping centers are moving to places where they can be walked to rather than on a way off highway somewhere." What intrigues me is that rates Oscar ownership per household and per person has started to come down two to three years before the downturn," says Micheal silk who studies this trend at the University of Michigan.The next reason is that increasing the use of cars will help the environment greatly. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe and 50% in the U.S. All of our development since World War 2 has been centered around cars, and it hasnt helped the environment any. For example, in Paris they were going to hale two no car days to reduce the smog. The first day they said that no one with and even numbered license plate were allowed to drive and odd would be the next. After the first day was over the smog was reduced by so much that they didnt even hale to use the next day. This is just a few people. Imagine if everyone would participate even just for small periods of time.In conclusion, now that you hale learned that life without cars can make you feel free, less dependent, and hale the environment. Hale you changed your opinion? "Giling up cars is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two sear bicycle with his wife.
