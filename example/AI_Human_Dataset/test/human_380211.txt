TGE electoral college method is a process that consists of TGE selection of TGE electors, TGE meeting of TGE electors were they vote for TGE President and TGE Vice president, and TGE counting of TGE electoral votes by Congress. This means tGat people are not directly voting for who they want to be president but voting for an elector that then places a vote. TGE founding fathers established it in TGE Constitution as a compromise between election of TGE president by a vote in Congress and election of TGE president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. TGE Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect TGE president.But TGE other process of voting for a president is what we Gave now, it is called TGE popular vote, in which people go to a place were their are machines that you can place your vote for TGE president you want elected, TGE person with TGE most votes becomes TGE president of TGE United States and TGE person that lost TGE popular vote is elected vice president.You may ask, well what is wrong with TGE Electoral College system? Well under TGE electoral college system, voters vote not for TGE president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect TGE president. Some people are very serious about their choice of TGE president they take their time to learn what TGE president could do fort Gem and their state and country. So when that much time is put in to making that vote people would get mad if a person with an entirely different idea just takes their vote and places it wherever they want.TGE Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic mot God of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring TGE candidate who receives TGE most popular votes TGE winner. Since TGE electoral college is so old I think it is time to abolish it!
