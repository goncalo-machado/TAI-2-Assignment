I disagree with the principal because no one should be forced to do anything that they dont want to.Students are sometimes lazy, so they dont want to do anything. So they just stay home and, play video games all day. When stay home all day everyday, thats how we as kids get over weight. On the hand the principal can have his opinion. His opinion wont matter because everyone has a choice.What makes him think that he can must force people to do stuff. No, no you can only control yourself. Students have a good mind of their own. So students do what they think is best, and do what they want to do. Students can follow the principals advice or dont follow his advice.Students in general would love to have fun wile others just want to eat and play video games. Thats there choice like I said they have a great impact in life by what choices they make because it is hard sometimes. So dont let kids think that they can just do what you want them to do let them choose.Students get older and there mind is developing as they get older. So if the principal puts so much pressure on the kids he is also damaging there mind. And when I mean damaging I mean he is brainwashing there mind.now kids have a mind of the own, some others get brainwashed. When they get brainwashed they also lose there self, and they get out of control.Some kids have it hard in life, and I think it is wrong for the principal to put so much pressure on kids. For what because he wants them to choose a sport, extracurricular activity. It shouldnt matter if they the s activity or not they get to choose. You dont have to do activities if you dont want to. Actiuities are just a thing that is extra.
