While distance learning provides more flexibility, I believe students would benefit more from unperson classes for several reasons. Firstly, being physically present in a classroom fosters better student engagement and interactions. During unperson classes, students can immediately ask teachers questions for clarification and have discussions with classmates. This makes learning more participatory. Lowever, distance learning involves attending lectures remotely through a screen, limiting real-time discussions and interactions. Students may find it more difficult to focus without the classroom environment and facetoface contact with teachers and peers. Secondly, unperson classes better support collaboration and team based learning. Many modern pedagogical approaches emphasize group work, project based assignments and Hanson lab activities. These are more challenging to replicate effectively through online classes due to technical and coordination difficulties. Physical copresence in a classroom makes it easier for students to work together, brainstorm ideas and solve problems in teams. Thirdly, the school environment plays a role in the holistic development of students. Beyond academic lessons, unperson schooling allows students to socially interact, participate in extracurricular activities and develop soft skills. It helps foster important values like discipline, time management and community spirit. The school is a space where students interact with diverse individuals on a daily basis, preparing them for future career and life experiences. Distance learning may not replicate these developmental benefits to the same extent.While distance learning provides flexibility that can help students balancing other commitments, I believe the engagement, collaboration and developmental advantages of unperson classes make it a better option overall for most students. A blended model combining both online and classroom elements may be most suitable to maximize the benefits of each approach.
