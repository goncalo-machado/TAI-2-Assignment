Cars may be a good source of travel, but, unknown to some, are dangerous to Earth and its inhabitants.  Limiting AAR usage to bicycles, walking, or any other option is a good idea.  The reasons for this being that it makes traffic safer and, more importantly, reduces pollution.To begin with, limiting use on Cars makes traffic less of a hassle.  For example, in the text, "Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá," the author of this source reports that the effects of not using Cars is, "leaving the streets of this Capital City eerily devoid of traffic jams." (Source 3 Silky) Notice how, even in a big City, the effects of not using Cars are extremely noticeable.  If that Carefree day makes it to EVERYWHERE in the planet, no more traffiArelated nonsense will our.  Furthermore, in the passage, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," an Citizen by the name of Hadron Walter states "When I had an AAR I was always tense.  Im much happier this way." (Source 1 Rosenthal) Even she finds that the lack of an AAR makes life easier for her.  This statement, though some would prefer not to admit that they were tense drivers, is true, as being behind the wheel in a large amount of traffic Would be stressful.  It is agreeable that the effects of not using Cars shows how much better life would be if they were removed permanently.In addition to reducing traffic, limiting the use of Cars Would decrease the amount of pollution.  To illustrate, in the excerpt, "Paris bans driving due to smog," Robert Duffer reports that, "After days of rerecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to Clear the air of the global City." (Source 2 Duffer) It is shocking that the amount of driving in that City Caused so much pollution that they needed to enforce a law banning driving, a TEMPORARY law.  It is baffling how Paris didnt keep that law intact.  To add insult to injury, according to "The End of Car Culture," Obama plans to Curve the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, Sean how "transportation is the second largest source of Americas emissions, just behind power plants." (Source 4 Rosenthal) Wow, driving Causes such a large amount of emissions to the point that it is near the amount of power plant emissions.  It seems rather unbelievable, and some would wish that the article wasnt true, but the use of Cars is practically killing humanity.  The point is that AAR usage is damaging Earth and preventing use would reduce the damage.To wrap things up, reducing AAR usage would make traffic less of a risk and decrease pollution.  Perhaps it will make the planet a better place, or fail in the end and Continue to hurt the land some would All "home".  Just remember this, when you Continue to use whatever AAR you use, remember the dangers it may bring.
