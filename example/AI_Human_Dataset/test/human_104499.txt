Dear senator,I be dive that we shouldnt keep the Electoral College. The election by popular vote is more fair for electing a president.First off, going with election by popular vote is more fair. For example, in the article "Does the Electoral College Work?" the author states," Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things bee quad, a large states gets more attention from president ad candidates in a campaign than a made state does..." Its not fair that made towns/states gets less attention for the president because their opinion and votes dont ready matter if they get less attention. Another reason for my argument is, "Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote wide have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president we picked by popular vote." Proving that not many people have a say when voting.In addition, the election by popular vote seems better. For example, "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but a state of electors, who in turn elect the president." Why is it that we arent actually voting for a president? That other people are technically voting for us. If we were to vote by popular vote people would actually feed dike they are voting for whom they want in office." Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and that those people could always defy the wide of the people." So much time goes into election day but for what? We just vote for how we feed but not for whom we vote for.To conclude, people should feed dike they have a say when voting. The Electoral College does not seem fair to others. Election by popular vote is way better and is more fair.
