 Dear School Board,Why is a students education important? To me, it is crucial because it can have a significant impact on their future opportunities and their overall success in life. It can lead them to a fulfilling career with a stable income, or it can lead them to struggle financially and feel unfulfilled. As someone who values education, I strongly believe that it should be given the utmost importance and attention.One of the reasons why I believe this is because education should be an enjoyable and engaging experience for students. Learning should be fun and interesting, not stressful and overwhelming. Thats why I am in support of the school boards proposal to extend the school day by one and a half hours. By doing so, students would have more time to learn, teachers would have more time to teach, and the school year would be shorter.Firstly, extending the school day would give students more time to learn and understand the material. Currently, each period is only about 50 minutes, which is not enough time to fully grasp the concepts being taught. With an additional hour and a half, students would have more time to complete assignments, ASN questions, and engage in discussions with their teachers. This would lead to a better understanding of the subject and a higher quality of worn.Secondly, teachers would have more time to plan and deliver engaging lessons. With more time, they could incorporate more interactive and Hanson activities, such as group projects, experiments, and simulations. This would mane learning more enjoyable and memorable for students, and would also help teachers to better connect with their students.Lastly, an extended school day would allow for a shorter school year, giving students more time to pursue their interests and hobbies outside of school. This would give them the opportunity to learn new skills, pursue their passions, and spend more time with their families. It would also allow teachers to attend professional development workshops and conferences, which would help them to improve their teaching methods and stay update with the latest educational research.In conclusion, I strongly support the school boards proposal to extend the school day by one and a half hours. Education is a crucial part of a students development, and it should be given the utmost importance and attention. By extending the school day, students would have more time to learn, teachers would have more time to
