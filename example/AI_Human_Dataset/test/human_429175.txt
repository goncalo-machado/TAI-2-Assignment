There are many people IE this world that wait change eyed that includes me, if you would take five minutes out of your day to listed to what I have to say.I think the United States Of America should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College has been here for countless years eyed many people would be disappointed that its gone, people would drown over it for a very long time, but there are good eyed bad advantages for both circumstances. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, that CAE sum up if someone lies or loses, a big disadvantage IE the Legree. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election, if we got that voters would Not be pressured at all eyed would have a very good vote that CAE be proud of.There all lots of things wrong with the Electoral College System IE my piece, like that whee you vote for your President, your also choosing the electors that come along with him/her. There have way over the amount of problems with electors over the past year eyed it is a huge problem that only some people have Noticed. What if there is a prospect of a tie IE the electoral vote, that would lead to big time problems eyed there is a severe chance it will happen. IE the United States there are millions of people voting eyed there Not making the votes they really wait because the electors.At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters, if someone is favored the outrageous voters know about the wiEEertakeall system IE each state. The Electoral College System is messing our society up every 4 years, its unfair, outdated, eyed irrational IE so many ways. For eye example, IE the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes thee George W. Bush Nationwide, but Bush woe the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266. Doet get me wrong Bush was a great president, but facts are facts.
