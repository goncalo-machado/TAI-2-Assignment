As an eighth grade student, I strongly believe that students should not be required to take music, drama, or art classes and that these should be electives. While some may argue that these subjects are essential for a well rounded education, I believe that they can often be pointless, unfair, and not important to take in order to provide evidence for my argument.Firstly, it is important to note that not all students have the same interests or talents. Some students may excel in music, drama, or art, while others may not. Forcing all students to take these classes regardless of their interests or abilities can be seen as unfair. It is important to give students the freedom to choose the subjects they want to pursue, as it allows them to focus on their strengths and passions.Secondly, it is important to consider the time and resources that are allocated to these subjects. In many schools, music, drama, and art classes take up valuable time that could be used for more important subjects such as math, science, and language arts. Furthermore, these subjects often require specialized equipment and materials, which can be costly. By making these subjects electives, schools can allocate more resources to subjects that are more important for students academic success.Finally, it is important to consider the practicality of these subjects in the real world. While some may argue that these subjects are essential for developing creativity and critical thinking skills, the reality is that many people in the workforce do not use these skills on a daily basis. In fact, some jobs may even require a lack of these skills. By making these subjects electives, students can choose to focus on subjects that are more relevant to their future careers.In conclusion, I strongly believe that students should not be required to take music, drama, or art classes and that these should be electives. By giving students the freedom to choose the subjects they want to pursue, schools can allocate more resources to subjects that are more important for students academic success, and students can focus on subjects that are more relevant to their future careers. It is important to consider the practicality of these subjects in the real world and to give students the opportunity to pursue their interests and passions.
