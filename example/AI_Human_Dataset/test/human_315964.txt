Hi, my name is Luke, and I am in the Seagoing Cowboys Program. There are a lot of reasons why I love this program. This program is run by UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They hired me to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. I think you should join this program and help me.Right away you will notice you can UO so many places! If you are a small town boy going on cattle boat trips, youre in for such a treat. You could possibly UO to Europe and China and explore all day. You even UET to UO to the most special place ever, Acropolis and Greece! Maybe in Greece youll find yourself at an AUE old theater. You could UO take an gondola ride in Hence, Italy, a city with streets of water. I not to tour an excavated castle and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.You may ask yourself,"How am I supposed to have fun and pass time on board? Its very easy actually, especially on return trips from when the animals have already been unloaded. We all played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. All the time on the boat you can find something to do. You always have time to sightseer while youre on it. You also have time for table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games helped us pass some time.Even for all the work that had to be done, it wasnt that bad. You had lots of time for sightseeing since it took a lot of time to UET to one place to another. Caring for animals during the crossings kept us busy. It just kept us busy, it wasnt very hard. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bass of oats had to be pulled up from the lowers holds of the ship. Plus, stalls had to be cleaned. All of this wasnt bad at all, you just had to UET use to the routine of it.In conclusion, band a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure.It will open up the world to you if you use your time wisely. This program will definitely make you more aware of people in other countries and their needs. That awareness will stay with you, and you and your family could host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. Im grateful for the opportunity, and you will be too.
