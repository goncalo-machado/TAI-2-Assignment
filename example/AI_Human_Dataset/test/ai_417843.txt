**Introduction**Have you heard about the Face on Mars? Its a mysterious, 1.5milewide rock formation that some people believe is the work of aliens. But scientists at NASA say that the Face is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will use evidence from the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" to argue that the Face is not a hoax and is instead a naturally occurring phenomenon.**Body**The article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" by Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bar presents a number of arguments against the idea that the Face is artificial. First, they point out that the Face is not symmetrical. If it were created by intelligent beings, they would have taken more care to make it perfectly symmetrical. Second, they argue that the Face is located in an area of Mars that is not geologically active. This means that it is unlikely that the Face was created by a volcanic eruption or other geological process. Third, they note that the Face is made of different materials than the surrounding terrain. This suggests that the Face is not a natural feature of Mars.I agree with Hoagland and Bar that the Face is not a hoax. The evidence they present is convincing and shows that the Face is a natural landform. However, I disagree with their conclusion that the Face is not of interest. I believe that the Face is still a fascinating and mysterious object that deserves further study.**Conclusion**The Face on Mars is a strange and enigmatic object that has captured the imagination of people all over the world. Whether it is a natural landform or the work of aliens, the Face is a reminder that we still have much to learn about our solar system.**Factual Inaccuracy**In the article, Hoagland and Bar state that the Face is located in the Colonia region of Mars. However, the Face is actually located in the Terra Aired region of Mars.**Spelling Errors**In the article, Hoagland and Bar misspell the word "geologically" as "geologically." They also misspell the word "symmetrical" as "symmetrical."
