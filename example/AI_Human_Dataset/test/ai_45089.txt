“A Life-Changing Experience Awaits You in the Seagoing Cowboys Program”Have you ever dreamt of exploring the world and making a difference? Then, I have some thrilling news for you! By joining the Seagoing Cowboys program as I did years ago, you can embark on the adventure of a lifetime.In 1945, my best friend and I embarked on a trip to post-war Greece with an unexpected cargo, a herd of beautiful and majestic horses, all in need of care, and we were the ones who would deliver them there. We spent weeks tending to these animals, learning about their needs and forming an unbreakable bond with them that we would always remember. This is only my first trip as a Sea Going Cowboy, and I can already tell you that this program would change your life forever. Not only did I travel with these wonderful creatures, but also to places that were so different from anything Id ever seen before. The landscapes and customs, the languages and music, the food and traditions were all so exciting, and my curiosity was piqued, leading me to explore new cultures and make new friends. I even got to meet people like the Dalai Lama and see places like China that I never would have seen otherwise. And let’s not overlook the fact that I was helping people who were in desperate need, which is one of the most rewarding feelings in the world.I know that it can be scary to try something new, especially in a foreign setting. But dont worry! The Seagoing Cows program has been in place and operating for more than seven decades, which means that the program is well established, with safety measures in place. There is always someone there to help you along the way if you need help. Plus, you will have your best friend with you!So, take a leap of faith, just like I did in 1945, by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will be doing the world a tremendous service, all the while gaining a unique experience that will change your world view.
