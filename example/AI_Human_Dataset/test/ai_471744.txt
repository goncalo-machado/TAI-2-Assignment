Hey there!  Uh, so, you Now, Ive been thinking a lot about this whole "doing something" thing. Life, its pretty important, you Now? And Thomas Jefferson was totally right when he said "determine never to be idle."  Life, thing about it, if were always doing something, were going to get so much more done! I mean, just thing about it. When were not doing anything, were not learning or growing or achieving our goals. Were just, life, sitting around doing nothing. And thats not good.  Its life, our brains are life, "Hey, what are we doing? Oh, nothing.  Lets just sit here and do nothing." And thats not how we get things done! But when were always doing something, were constantly learning and growing and achieving our goals. Were life, "Okay, I want to learn how to play the guitar. So, Im gonna pick up that guitar and practice every day."  And then, before we Now it, were life, "Whoa, I can play the guitar!  I accomplished something!" And its not just learning new things, its also about, life, working towards our goals. Whether its getting good grades or starting a business or, life, anything really. If were always doing something, were always moving towards our goals. Were not just sitting around, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for things to happen. So, yeah, I totally agree with Thomas Jefferson. Its wonderful how much we can do if were always doing something.  Its life, the more we do, the more we can achieve. And thats just, life, totally awesome! In conclusion, always doing something is super important. It helps us learn, grow, and achieve
