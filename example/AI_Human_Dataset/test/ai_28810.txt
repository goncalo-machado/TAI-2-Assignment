 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to determine who will be President and Vice President. The system was created by the framers of the Constitution in 1787, and it has been in place ever since. The electoral college allows states to have a say in who becomes President and Vice President. Each state is given a certain number of electoral votes based on the population of that state. The total number of electoral votes in the United States is 538. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to receive at least 270 electoral votes. In 2016, President Donald Trump received 304 electoral votes and Hillary Clinton received 227 electoral votes, which is why Trump won the presidency.The electoral college has been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. Some have argued that it is an unfair system that doesnt truly reflect the will of the people. One of the main concerns with the electoral college is that it can be influenced by special interest groups and political action committees. These groups can spend millions of dollars and influence politicians to vote for a certain candidate. This means that the voices of ordinary people may not always be heard in the final election.Another problem with the electoral college is that it can result in candidates focusing only on certain states and ignoring others. States with a large population and a lot of electoral votes may receive more attention from candidates, while states with fewer electoral votes may be overlooked. This can result in candidates not campaigning in states with smaller populations, which could be problematic because many people living in these states may not know as much about the candidates or have access to the information they need to make an informed decision.Despite these problems, many people still believe that the electoral college works and is necessary for the United States. They argue that without it, the candidate with the most votes in large states could win the presidency, even if the candidate with the most votes nationally is someone else. They also argue that the electoral college allows states to have a say in who becomes President and Vice President, which is fair because not every state has the same population and economic status.In conclusion, the electoral college is a controversial and complex system used to determine who will be President and Vice President of the United States. While it has its problems, many people still believe that it works and is necessary for the United States. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of the electoral college before making any decisions about its future. Ultimately, the success of the electoral college will depend on the actions of politicians and voters, as well as the ability to effectively address the challenges it presents.
