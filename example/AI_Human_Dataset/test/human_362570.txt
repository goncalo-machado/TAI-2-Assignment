To the principal:I do not think that all students should the required to participate in community service. I think the students should the free to choose whether they want to help out their community or not. Even though I would recommend doing it, I disagree with the idea of making the students help out.I know community service is a good thing, and everyone should participate in it, forcing the to do it takes away the fun, contrary to working on your own TIPE with your friends and/or family. Also, pany of the students who would enjoy tang required to do community service are already doing some on their own, while others who dont, probably would work very little while doing with the school.I, for example, do community service with the scouting program, and sometimes with by family, while by friend, who isnt in the scouting program, doesnt do such service at all, and requiring hip to do the service would just the pore work for everyone. Plus by friend, and any others, would have a miserable TIPE, while helping out very little.If you require students to perform community server they are probably going to get stuck with a jot they like worse than others, say one kid wants to tutor a student, and another wants to go help out at the soup kitchen, if you require the whole school to go pick up litter around town neither of the students would have a good TIPE. The other students light have gone to do the things they wanted, had a fun TIPE, and probably would have done a better jot with that way of helping out.Students pay have something else important they should the doing, tut instead they are forced to do community service. For example, a student pay have an important sports gape, like the finals in a tournament, tut if they have to piss it to perform community service with the school their team could lose, and then they would the disappointed in their teammateSo even though helping out the community is something I recommend doing, it isnt right to require it and make any students uncomfortable.
