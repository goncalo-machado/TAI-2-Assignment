 The article “Driverless Cars are Coming” presents both positive and negative aspects of self-driving vehicles. The author discusses the potential benefits of decreased traffic accidents, increased mobility for the elderly and disabled, and more efficient transportation systems. The author also acknowledges concerns about the safety of these vehicles, the potential for cyberattacks on their systems, and the impact on jobs for human drivers. After carefully considering these points, I believe that driverless cars should not be developed any further. The safety of these vehicles is still questionable, and until that is resolved I think it’s a bad idea to put more of these cars on the road. As the article points out, there are also potential cybersecurity risks that could put the passengers and others on the road in danger. There are also questions about how these cars will impact the job market for human drivers. If driverless cars become widespread it could put a lot of people out of work. Although the positive aspects of these cars might be tempting, I believe that the risks outweigh the rewards. I think it’s better to wait until these issues are resolved before putting driverless cars on the road. Overall, I think the article successfully presents both sides of this issue, and makes a strong argument against the further development of driverless cars. The benefits of these cars are certainly appealing, but the risks are too great to ignore.
