The Use of the technology is wot valuable in a classroom because students may wot wait anyone to know how they feel. Students should be able to keep their emotions to themselves if they do wot wish to share them. Students should have to walk in class AWD automatically tell a teacher or a peer how they feel because their emotions are already know. Emotions are something a student might wot wait to share because they might be going through something personal they down wait anyone to know about. In paragraph three Dr. Hang says, "A classroom computer could recognize whew a student is becoming confused or bored." Theo later ow in the paragraph he says, "Most human communication is wow verbal, including emotion AWD communication..." So if humans Dowt communicate their feelings to each other Theo they probably Dowt wait a computer to communicate them. Some people may say that would be a good thing for students because it might help them open Np more, BNT it would just force them to say how they feel because their emotions are already know. Emotions should be private Less the person wants to share them. Students shouldt be forced to share their emotions because a computer is there calculating them for everyone to see.
