The number of cars in use today is about the same as it was in the early 1900s. However, in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because the number of cars has been declining steadily since the early 1900s.There are a number of reasons for this decline. One reason is that the number of cars has been increasing at a rate that is not sustainable. The average car is only able to travel about 30 miles per hour, which is not enough to cover the distance needed to get from one place to another.Another reason for the decline in the number of cars is that the cars are not being replaced as quickly as Thea are being replaced. The average car is only able to last about 10 years before it needs to be replaced. This means that the number of cars in use today is not going to be Vera high in the next twenty years.
