The debate as to whether people choose their own character traits or are shaped by outside influences has raged on for centuries. On the one hand, many people believe that individual character is predetermined and largely shaped by factors such as family upbringing, education, economic status, and other societal influences. On the other hand, those who hold that people can choose their own character traits point to free will and personal choice as the deciding factors. Regardless of which side of the debate you end up on, one thing is certain: the interplay between the environment and the individual is complex and shaped by a multitude of factors. Genetics, family, society, and culture are all powerful factors in shaping a persons character, and some researchers have taken these factors into account in their studies. However, it is also true that people can make conscious choices that affect the development of their character; therefore, choice also plays a role in the overall formation of ones character. At the end of the day, whether people choose their own character traits or they are shaped by external influences is a complex question with no definitive answer. Research has shown that both factors play a part in the development of character, and only by taking into account both environmental and individual factors can we fully understand the role each plays.
