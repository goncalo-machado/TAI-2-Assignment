As WC all know cars arc a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than WC think. Some people cant live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. WC may not think about it however there arc multiple advantages to not using a car. When WC limit our car us cit saves THC earth also it I said that it takes away a HCAP load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, on day without THC USC of cars. How would that bc?Wc think of saving THC earth WC think of recycling, rousing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars arc responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in THC United States? According to "In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal. In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that cvcnnumbcrcd license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31. Almost 4000 drivers CRC find that day and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of THC cars in Paris arc disc ran so THC smog is worst. If they cut down on their car us cit would lower THC smog.You might not think of it but if WC limited THC USC of cars it clinics stress. According to "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans structs arc compactly car FCC. 70 percent of Vaughns families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Hidden Walter said"When I had a car I was always CNSC. Im much happicrthis way". According to "Carry DAT in spinning into a big hit in Bogotá" by Andrew Silky in Bogotá, Columbia they have BCC without cars for 3 years. Also, Carlos Arturo Plaza said "Its a good opportunity total away stress and lower THC air pollution".According to "THC End of Car Culture" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans arc buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. THC number of miles driven in THC United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Editor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they arc saving money.So I believe that theyRC many reason to have a car. However theyRC many advantages to limiting your car USC. You can think of yourself as doing a good CCD to THC earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike arc catching THC bus. You can have a clear mind and size stressing so much. Also, you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money on way or another. Instead of driving your car to THC mall you can save that money and catch THC bus to THC mall and buy that NCW purse that you have BCC dying to GCT.
