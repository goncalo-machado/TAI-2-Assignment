DEAR PRINCIPALI feel that its unfair for you to make that the new policy because some students try their best to get good grads but Its just not that easy for most kids to get a and B because Its just not how the get their grades, so you say many kids in the school Heine a C average, so maybe you can ask those kids whats so hard about that subject or the work why do you Heine a C in that class or subject what can I get the teacher to do to get help how is the environment your working in is it to loud, disrupting is it the teacher not paying attenuation or is it you.Some kids just dont want to do anything in the class, so those kids will not get to do sports and activitys or the fine the kids with low grades help and then if grades are still bad then yeah Its ok to not let them do it but for all of them no still unfair if they at lest Heine a CIn the class they can still participate in sports and activitys they just Heine to try harder but I still think its unfair because as long as their trying there best thats all that matters and then if the kids can bring there grads up so no new policy just new ways to help students bring grades up.
