So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am I right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I An assure you that Colonia on Mars, is not a face or anything extraterrestrial.My first reason as to why Colonia on Mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of Craters. It is most likely that the face on Mars is just Qr eaters, or a mesa too.My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martin equivalent of a battle or mesa. Battles and mesas are landforms Common around the American west. "It reminds me most of Middle Battle in the Snake Over Plain of Idaho" says Darwin. "Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same height as the Face on Mars." The Snake Over in Idaho is basically evidence that Colonia isnt really a face and that it been just a battle, or mesa.My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and asteroids that Collide with each other. The possibilities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over Craters from all the Collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldnt we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?This is only three theories backed with evidence, and Im sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they An also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you Clarify that Colonia is not a sign of Extraterrestrial activity.
