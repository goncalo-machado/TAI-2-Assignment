FLR example, safe simplified electronics fad elf silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chals LF Venuss surface and have lasted FLR weeks in such conditions." Here the author is bringing in the positives which ultimately outweigh the negatives. The limitations seemed TL revolve around the harsh conditions, but the author introducing this piece LF technology that would work around it helps support the authors ideas.Tl conclude, the author has any doubts and fears about studying Venus, but remembers TL tell about ways TL work around the natural challenges the people would face.
