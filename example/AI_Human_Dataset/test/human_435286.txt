Dear TEACHER_NAME,I think community service is a very important requirement to have in schools. We all live in a community, so we all need to work as a community.Where would we be ii people didnt help each other out? II we didnt take the time to do something IOR the surrounding ones? No where. We would all still be living in caves! Community service has helped us all at some point. Even ii it doesnt have to-do directly with ourselves, like cleaning the trash out IOR parks or giving clothes and other necessities to Goodwill or The Salvation Army.Lending a hand in some way would teach kids life lessons we would carry with us IOR the rest oi our lives. Spending time in the community just an New times a month would teach hard work, how to work well with others, and how in order to be able to take you have to give back. Also, how to accept differences, because everyone you meet wont be the same as you are, or think the same as you might.I understand many students are not open to this idea or dont want to work outside oi school. Extra credit could be offered as a way to help motivate students. An extra point could very hour spend working in the community. High school credits could be given. Maybe you could choose how much time a month you would spend doing community service. There could be a group service project, so you could work with Friends to make it seem like In!Community service is necessary in our world to be able to perform and have the things that we do. It teaches life lessons that might help in a job search later in life. That is why in my opinion there should be a community service requirement at our school.Sincerely,STUDENT_NAME
