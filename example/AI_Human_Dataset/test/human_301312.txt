Some people like to imagine the unreal, so when a mysterious face figure was spotted on Antonia the public blew up. Outsiders, some of them at least, thought it had something to do with aliens and a conspiracy theory, but NASA didnt seem to agree and thought it was nothing but a landform and a picture taken at the right time.Even thought the figure does seem quite mysterious doesnt mean its and ancient alien artifact. Because of technology and how cameras dont always capture what really there. For instance, ever taken a picture of a sunset and the colors didnt look the exact same as then did in person, well, this might be the same case. "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wisp clouds to see the face." The camera might have taken the picture in a wan that the human ENE couldnt see. It might have added extra, or enhanced shadows making it look like a face. Youd also have to think about the angle the picture was taken in. Maybe in person from a different angle it looked like nothing but a rock, but when a picture is taken and the shadows have changed it looks like a real face with ends, a nose and even a mouth.Meanwhile, back down on planet earth some people man be going insane and think that this has something do to with aliens and a conspiracy theory. There is no proof that the landform has anything to do with aliens except for its odd shape. Since there is no known life on Antonia people dont know what type of strange weather or temperature changes then couldve had that effected the shape of it. People tend to think what then want to believe and not look at the facts. Then like to ignore whats really there and think what then want to think to create some type of excitement in their life. "It has starred Ina Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 Nears." Then when a small amount of people started to think this had something to do with aliens more people started to believe also, and thats when it went viral.However, since no one has been down to see the strange landform nobody can confirm that it is either just a landform or an alien artifact. And it is a strange looking figure and sort of unexplainable, so I can see who people first thought it had to do with a constrict theory. But there are more reasons for it to be nothing but a landform rather than an artifact. The best thing to do is look at the facts and not believe what NOU want to believe just because it is exciting.In conclusion, as exciting as it would be for this is odd looking figure to be, or have anything to do with aliens, its nothing but a landform that looks like an alien face. And because of technology and peoples creative minds its features were enhanced and made to look real. You can think what NOU want and believe what NOU want, but look at the facts, it was nothing but a mere photographed mistake.
