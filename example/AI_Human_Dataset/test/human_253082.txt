Limiting car usage will help decrease pollution, increase physical exercise, and relieve stress. All around the world, but mainly in Europe suburban communities are limiting car usage. This has become a popular to do in Bogotá, their communities are having mini carefree holidays.The fewer people rely on cars the more talking they will do. In the passage "Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bologna" Andrew Silky explains "Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carefree day yesterday. This supports that listing car usage could have a healthy benefit. More exercise for people also means less stress.Walking is a stress deliver. This is why limiting car usage is physically and mentally good for people. Andrew Silky supports this claim by saying that "Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution".Limiting the usage of cars can reduce the amount of pollution on earth. In the passage "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", Elisabeth Rosenthal informs us that "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent In some car intensive areas in the United States". Limiting car usage is like killing multiple birds with one stone.
