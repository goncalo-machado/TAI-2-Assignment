My interest in the medical field began at an early age. Growing up, I was exposed to a number of medical professionals in my community who inspired me to pursue medicine as a career. I cherish the knowledge I have learned and am driven to pass it onto the next generation. I believe that partnering with the next generation to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration would be useful for both sides. It would help me to learn more about the eve revolving medical field and new technologies, while at the same time invest in the future of healthcare by educating the next generation. By providing mentorship, I hope to not only facilitate the learning of the new generation of medical professionals but also inspire others to pursue their dreams and ambitions.
