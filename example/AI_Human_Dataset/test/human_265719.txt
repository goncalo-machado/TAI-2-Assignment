The invention of the car was a revolution in itself, developing a new, faster way to get to far away places. However, the more people use transportation the more it seems to affect our everyday lives in both positive and negative ways. Transportation can cause a lot of pollution which could in later years really affect how people live their lives today, but a new carefree revolution could be just what the world needs to delay that probable outcome.Pollution comes from all different kinds of things like cars, factories, and even smoking. Right now this is the only world in which is stable for people to live on and all these things that pollute the air could risk how much longer people get to have it. Andrew Silky says that in Bogotá, Columbia the 7 million citizens have dedicated a day in which no personal car transportation is used. This one day has not only helped reduce the pollution, but also benefit the town in many ways. Such as new parks and stores have been able to open, sidewalks have been repaved, rush hour restrictions cutting the traffic down, and also the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. This "Carefree Day" has also reached out into other countries as well and according to Enrique Rear, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, "These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."A businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza says that the "Carefree Day" in Bogotá is, "a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Just one day without having to drive and worry about the risks of driving can take a weight of stress off of some peoples shoulders. In Vauban, Germany there are no residents that own a single car. Elisabeth Rosenthal described the city saying that, "Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district..." Some towns residents said that having a car would always have them tense, and they were much happier living in a "no car city". Having to deal with every day stress is hard enough, but when you have to deal with additional driving stress it can really take a toll on some people."Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying power cars, driving less and getting power licenses as each year goes by," says Rosenthal. America has long been known as one of the worlds prime car cultured countries in the world, but since the peak of miles driven in 2005 these miles have been steadily decreasing with every year. Studies have shown that there has been a big drop in the percentage of 16 to 39 yearolds who get their license. The percentage of young drivers getting their licenses has decreased by 23% between the years 2001 and 2009 in America alone. A decrease in people owning their own vehicles means that there could be a decrease in the pollution that cars burden the earth with every year.Bogotá, Colombia is a great example of a new revolution soon to come. This hopeful revolution will not only decrease pollution, but stress as well. A decrease in the population of young people getting their licenses could also greatly affect the way in which the world transports people from place to place. Transportation can cause a lot of pollution which could in later years really affect how people live their lives today, but a new carefree revolution could be just what the world needs to delay that probable outcome.
