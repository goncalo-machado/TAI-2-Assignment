School, a crucial building block of a childs life where one finds them self. Year in and hear out students are forced to be condemned to these drier halls where information is crammed into their brains 7 hours a day, five days a week. But theres a small period in every hear that students get a much needed break, that being summer vacation. A few months in the heat of to hear students take a break from school to regroup themselves and spend tie with their friends and family. In order to retain the information that students have obtained throughout to hear, and keep their minds active teachers will assign books to read and projects to complete before the school hear starts. These summer projects however, are time, energy, and effort spent during what is supposed to be a childs vacation so you would think that the student should be able to do something that the hare interested in, right? Summer projects should be student designed because of the time, skill, and effort that will be displayed differently BH every student.In order to get the brain back into the school mode for students, it takes time. Time vary between everybody because no one is on the same schedule. One person that has done nothing all summer will have a lot more time to complete a good, well thought project, versus someone thats been away at sleep away camp all summer. Who should it be the teachers right to decide how much time you should be able to get on a project the assigned having no idea about hour plan for the summer? If a student was allowed to make their own project based on what the have time for, the project will be a lot better than if the crammed a ton of information the hare not prepared for with that small amount of time. Projects would not only be neater, but more sophisticated because the did what the could do with the time the set aside. No one teacher could possible know how much time you have, but also the true amount of skill that you also possess.Going into to hear the teacher does not really know what you can do from an academic standpoint he so who should the assume hour skill with a before school, summer project? In order for a teacher to get a feel to where hour ability level lies, the must first get to know you and see hour potential. A project that is assigned to one student could be in someones wheelhouse, while another kid could really struggle on the subject that the project is on. There is no was of knowing unless the project is driven BH what the student wants and what the student is able to achieve. Students should be able to harness their abilities for their summer project that will also display their effort.Effort for school in the summer is not something that ANH student would want to do. Being cooped up inside doing a project for school instead of going to the pool with hour friends is something that Im willing to bet, no kid would choose to do. If students were allowed to choose their summer project the might be more willing to put in effort versus some boring, strict guidelines thing that a teacher would assign. Effort is hard to get out of a kid during the long, dog days of summer, so how can you expect them to put in their effort on something the know is painful and creativity destroying? The effort shown from students still might not be sufficient, but it will be better if its something the kid wants to do, and not just assigned from a teacher. Kids want freedom, and with freedom to decide hour project thats due at the end of summer vacation only seems right. If youre going to make students work on their vacation at least let them do it BH their standards, and dont just tell them blatantly what to do.
