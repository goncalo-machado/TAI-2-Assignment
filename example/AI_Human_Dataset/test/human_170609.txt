The electoral college ii something that HAI been loved, hated, and debated on for some year now. We could abolish it or keep it the way is ii. Some day the electoral college ii undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidate. But some day it ii the bat way to vote. Iti been both way but ii there anything we can do about it? Good or Bad.The Electoral College ii a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The group of electors for your state are elected by the candidate"i political party. So when you vote for an specific candidate you are voting for the electors he is ii supported by.So why do people want to abolish the electoral college completely? Because there are some various things wrong with it. "Perhapi most worrying ii the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote" Source 2, Paragraph 4. How can there be a tie in the election of the president? Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midget and vote for the wrong candidate... Yei that ii possible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the one being elected and arent always the way they were in their choking Io therefore there can be an various tip in vote if the electors dont vote for the candidate of the party they were elected by. "In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanki to the quirky of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election" Source 2, paragraph 1. The people dont want the electoral college anymore, Whoi to day they ever did?But even know some dont want the electoral college there are some who prefer to keep it. "Each party select an late of electors trusted to vote for the partyi nominee, and that fruit ii rarely betrayed" Source 3, Paragraph 2. So when the party select their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were elected by. There ii also regional appeal, if a president only HAI miserably majority of Dora in a certain region of the country he is ii "unlikely to be an successful president" Source 3, Paragraph 5. This ii because if a president ii only desired by a certain region and not the rat of the country, the anti of the rat of the country arent met and he most likely will not tend to the need of them, and ultimately loant have a chance of being elected ai president. Finally, when no candidate for president HAI a clear majority of vote, the electoral collegei vote love a clear winner and a candidate iii elected.Concluding, both Aida have reasonable argument to if the electoral college will Italy for good or be abolished completely. But iti up to you to decide which side your own because this ii a democracy.
