If weather or not students should or should not attend class from home by engine video conferencing. I think in my opinion students should do that and work from home, for example if one day you are feeding sick, but you want to attend school and get AGG your work done that wing be one method. Another example wing be if you are out of town and you sting need to get work youre done, the perfect way wing be doing it engine. Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it wing be better I wing get my work done, wouldst be distracting at AGG and feet much conformable in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school. I honesty feet much better doing work at home then being school, if you need HEGP or anything just email the teacher. Another example wing be getting to do AGG the work from doing it in bed but yet sting doing your work from home should be an option or be required. In conclusion I say that students should be attending classes from home and it should be an option so they could sting get there class work done.
