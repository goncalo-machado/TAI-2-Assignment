It in common for advertisement to feature people we want to be like, AK there ad campaign often attempt to persuade viewers to purchase a product or Service by Showcasing attractive and Successful individual. While this may be an effective marketing tool, I disagree with the notion that ADK Should portray people we want to be like, AK it can lead to negative body image issue and unrealistic expectations.The most common ADK that Showcase people we want to be like are those for beauty and clothing product, which typically feature attractive model with perfect physique. When young people are exposed to there image, they may feel inadequate and fall into comparison track. There feeling of inadequacy can lead to depression, anxiety, and other negative mental health issue. For example, a Study conducted by researchers at the University of Sussex evaluated the effect of viewing various type of advertising on the mood of teenage girl. They found that viewing advert featuring idealized model had a negative effect on the participants’ KelfeKteem and body image.The use of celebrities in ADK can also lead to unrealistic expectations. Many people are drawn to the glamour and fame associated with celebrities, which can lead to a misguided attempt to emulate their lifestyle. This can be particularly damaging for young people, AK they may be unaware of the amount of hard work and dedication required to achieve Such Success. Furthermore, celebrities are often depicted in a manner that in not reflective of reality; for example, many celebrities are heavily airbrushed and photoshopped in order to create an idealistic version of themselves. This can create an unrealistic Standard that in difficult to attain, leading to feeling of disappointment and frustration.Rather than using people we want to be like in their ad campaign, companies Should focus on portraying genuine, relatable people. This can be achieved by featuring individual from different background and of various Shape and Size. Such representation will help to create a more inclusive marketing message and will help to dispel the unrealistic expectations that are often created by ADK featuring idealized model.Additionally, companies Should Strive to focus on Showcasing the qualities of their product or Service rather than the physical attributed of the model used in their campaign. This will help to create a more meaningful message, while also avoiding the potential pitfalls of featuring idealized model.In conclusion, I disagree with the notion that ADK Should portray people we want to be like AK it can lead to negative body image issue and unrealistic expectations. Companies Should Strive to create more meaningful message by featuring genuine, relatable people from diverse background.
