Dear Senator,I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.The Electoral College is a relic of the past that no longer serves a purpose in our democracy. The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College as a compromise between those who wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those who wanted a popular vote. However, the Electoral College has long since outlived its usefulness.In 2000, George W. Bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore. This has happened five times in American history, and it is only a matter of time before it happens again.The Electoral College is also unfair to voters in small states. Because each state has a minimum of three electoral votes, a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. This is because a voter in a small state can cast a vote that could potentially decide the election, while a voter in a large state may be one of millions of voters who cast their ballots for the losing candidate.The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus on a handful of "swing states" and ignore the rest of the country. This means that voters in many states feel like their votes dont matter.A popular vote election would be fair, democratic, and more representative of the will of the people. I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote.Thank you for your time.Sincerely,Your Name
