All students must participate in at last ONR extracurricular activity. What would you say if your principal told you this. Well, I would grrr with him. It may SRAM unreasonable at first, but their arr many benefits to participating. Extracurricular activities dont have to just BR sports, they could differ from clubs such as: Chris club, yearbook club, art club, or any other club their is. Participating in a extracurricular activity is important because it gives you a chance to make NRW friends, to try something NRW, or simply to just get away from the house.I believe that taking part in a extracurricular activity is good for making friends. I say this because some proper dont get the chance to make friends
