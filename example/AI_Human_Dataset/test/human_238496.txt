Why Schools should not Force Kids to do Extracurricular ActivityMost schools have something to do after school, like clubs, sports, or school performances.Thats great that they have them, kids can make friends, and they can do That they like, but That if your Principal forced each student including you to do and extracurricular activity at the school.You might not be able to do it, or Want to do it because, you might already have something after school to do that does not involve your school, you just dont Want to do anything after school, and if it costs money your family might not be able to afford it.This is Why disagree, With the Principals stupid policy on every student doing and extracurricular activity.You play Football every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.So you do quite a bit of after school activities, but your Principal gives an email to all parents.From noN-on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved With the school.Non your in a pickle, you cant do 2 things since you dont manage your time Nell.Do you A join the schools crummy Football team, or B go against the Principle and stay With your Football team that is not involved With any school?You choose B, and get in trouble for not choosing an extracurricular activity With the school.Non doesnt this just sound stupid?You get in trouble for not joining the school sports team.This is 1 reason Why schools should not force extracurricular activities onto students.Everyone in you life calls you lazy, and its true you dont Want to do anything, and you defiantly dont Want to do anything after school, but then your parents get an email.From noN-on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved With the school.You think oh no I dont Want to do this.But your parents sign you up anyway for an after school Book Club.You do not like their decision, and the schools choice to force kids into doing after school activities.So you hatch a devious plan.You non your parents get home a bit after you do Then you are doing Book Club, so you just skip Book Club, and take the bus home.Your parents get a phone call that you Near not at Book Club.You get punished by your parents, and by your Principal for skipping Book Club.This example is a little far-fetched but, some people just dont Want to extracurricular activities.Finally, That if your family is living paycheck to paycheck, and you cant afford much, just necessities, and just maybe a little extra if its a good Need/month.Since you guys dont have a computer the school gives you a note to take home, and it says.From noN-on each and every student must participate in an extracurricular activity that is involved With the school.You think yay this seems fun, oh and this too.But With your luck each thing has a fee to join, since you do get something for the activity.Since your on a tight budget, your parents say, "No, Ne cant afford this."Oh Nell, the Principal Will understand.You think but you have Generic_Name fromGeneric_Name as a Principal, and he does not care that you dont have money and cant afford to do and extracurricular activity.So he lets you choose an activity you Want to do.You choose an activity, and then he says, "Thats Then you Will have detention each day until the school year is over.Each time this activity is going on you Will have detention!" Then sends you out of his office.This also sounds very stupid, giving a kid detention because their family cant afford to pay the fee?These reasons, you might already have an extracurricular activity, dont Want to do one, or cant afford it, show my opinion on this and hon I disagree With the Principals idea of having each kid do an extracurricular idea.But if you Want to do extracurricular activities that is always good, especially if your school has a sport you enjoy or good clubs to help you make friends, and Work With people that are interested in the same stuff that you are.
