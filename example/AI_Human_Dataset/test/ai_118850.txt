Schools should allow students to design their own summer projects rather than having teachers design mandatory assignments. Student designed projects are more engaging and better promote continued learning over the break. When students are given the freedom to choose their own summer project topics based on their own interests, they are far more motivated to dedicate time and effort into completing meaningful work. For example, a student interested in art may choose to spend their summer practicing different techniques or learning about famous artists. Meanwhile, a student passionate about science could opt to conduct simple experiments or research emerging fields of study. By choosing projects related to their personal passions and hobbies, students are intrinsically motivated to dive deeper into subjects they genuinely find interesting.In contrast, teacher designed assignments risk feeling like more “homework” assigned over the summer. If students are given mandatory topics and guidelines by their teachers that may not align with their interests, they are less likely to engage fully with the work. It is unrealistic to expect students to dedicate as much time and energy into completing projects they have little personal investment in. Forcing students to adhere to teacher guidelines for summer work also limits creativity and personal exploration of topics outside the regular curriculum. Finally, allowing students to self direct their summer learning through projects of their own choosing fosters independence and responsibility. By setting their own goals and managing their own schedules without constant teacher oversight, students develop valuable self learning skills. They learn to pursue knowledge and challenges according to their aspirations, with the understanding that lifelong learning does not stop once school lets out for the summer break. Overall, student designed summer projects are a more effective way to keep students engaged in learning outside a traditional classroom setting.
