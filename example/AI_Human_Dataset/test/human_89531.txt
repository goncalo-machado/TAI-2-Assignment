If I were a scientist at NASA and I was discussing the Face with someone who doesnt think the Face was just land formation I would say, it is because of what other scientist in NASA believe it was a land formation that looked like a real human face.The Face was just something formed by the planet because the article says, "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." Which means that it been just a rock that was formed a different way to look like it was a face. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but there were more scientists to prove them wrong. Another piece of evidence was when they were taking pictures Gavin said, "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added. "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. This evidence goes with my argument because if it was some type of alien signal the camera would have picked it up, and they would have seen what it really was, but they didnt have all they saw was a landform like the ones around American West.In conclusion it was not an alien signal, or artifact, it was just a piece of land formed differently. Now you all know it wasnt from aliens. All it was, was an illusion that looked like a real human face with a nose, eyes, and more. Dont assume everything on other planets are always from aliens because for now we dont have proof aliens exist.
