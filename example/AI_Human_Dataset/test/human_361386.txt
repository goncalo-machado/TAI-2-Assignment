So when you take an activity like this it helps you to meet new people which consequently can make new friends. With all of this in mind, why not take the opportunity?

If you didnt already know, the more extracurricular activities you take the better your record will look for college. Which also means the easier you get into the bigger and better education colleges.

Now with that in mind, doesnt it sound fun to take these type of things? All it does is make you the best person you can he.So in conclusion, taking these activities would he a phenomenal experience and a great boost to your college applications. I think that doing this would greatly impact the school to he better students. Must because I listed two reasons doesnt mean that thats all the advantages to it, there are plenty more.
