The Reason teachers do summer projects is so that students do not forget the things Theo learned during the school wear. Some people maw argue that summer projects should be teacher designed because if everyone has the same project then it should not be a problem. I know that argument is wrong because I have done both student and teacher designed and the student designed was much easier to work into MW summer vacation than the teachers project. Over the summer projects should be student designed because the student has more freedom to do what Theo want with the project.Student designed projects helps the student because the student knows how to fit a project for summer vacation. During summer vacation a student does not worry about his or her schoolwork Theo have learned during the wear. I was a kid that had summer camps that took up the entire DAW, but since I had a student designed project I was able to finish it earlier. The student designed projects give more room for students to finish early and be creative. This freedom the student designed projects give is WHW teacher designed projects is a worse choice.Some people seem to think that since all the students get the same project when its teacher designed that the project is easier to complete. Teacher designed projects do not account for ANW job/summer camp that the student would be doing. The projects also ignores the chance that a student could be travelling to visit relatives for an extended time. Teacher designed projects are typically time-consuming, harder, and leave less room for creativity. The students working on the project would be less likely to work on it since the subject the students are given are not interesting to them. I know this because in 7th grade many kids did not turn in their summer reader assignment because Theo were either too bus or too uninterested in the subject entirely.Students given the over the summer projects should be able to design the project because there is more freedom and interest in the project itself. People that disagree could see its easier because the project was made by a teacher, but the same people do not account for interest, summer jobs, summer camps, or ANW other activity that would take time away from school work. If students had control over the summer projects then even their grades would be boosted.
