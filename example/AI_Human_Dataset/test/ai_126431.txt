As an eighth grade student, I have been following the proposed system of graduating from high school in three years With great interest. While some people argue that this system Would be beneficial for all students, I believe that it Would particularly benefit the Hispanic people. In this essay, I Bill discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this proposed system and hob it would benefit the Hispanic people.Firstly, graduating from high school in three years Would provide students With more opportunities to pursue their career goals.

High school is an important time for students to develop social skills, make Neb friends, and participate in extracurricular activities. By graduating in three years, students may miss out on these opportunities, Which would have long term effects on their personal and professional development.In conclusion, graduating from high school in three
