Hey there, so you think that aliens created the Face on Mars? Well, let me tell you, thats just not true. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform, and Im here to tell you why.First of all, lets talk about the size of the Face. According to the article, its huge, spanning over 1.5 miles across and 1 mile tall. Thats definitely not something that could be created by aliens. I mean, think about it, it would take a lot of work to build something like that on a planet thats not even inhabited by humans.Another thing to consider is that the Face is not even a face at all. Its just a hill with some strange features that, when looked at from a certain angle, kind of look like a face. But honestly, if aliens were going to create a face on Mars, dont you think they would make it more... well, face-like? Not just a bunch of random hills and valleys.And have you ever heard of pareidolia? Its a psychological phenomenon where people see familiar patterns in random or ambiguous visual stimuli. This is whats happening with the Face on Mars. People are seeing a face because they want to see a face, not because its actually there.So, there you have it. The Face on Mars is not some alien creation, its just a natural landform that we happen to see as a face. Dont get me wrong, its still pretty cool, but lets not get carried away with our imagination. We have to rely on science and evidence, not just our desire to believe in something extraordinary. Thank you for listening to my argument, I hope you now see things a little more clearly.
