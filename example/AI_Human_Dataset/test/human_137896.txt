Deer center, I feel that we should change using the Electoral college. The popular vote is much more effective. Using the popular vote to decide who becomes president would show who the citizens of the united States went. The popular vote shows what each state HNS voted for, using the Electoral college takes the right any for the people being able to vote for the president that they favor. Instead of using what the people voted for they come together to choose the candidate they predict would be the best and do the most for the country and thats not fair. If voting is important to this country then congress should understand that when the people vote for something everyone wants it to be their decisions that makes one of the two candidates become president not who the Electoral college believes would be best. If we could overcome the debate between what process works better more people might vote.Although some citizens believe that the Electoral college is n good idea. I feel that if they compared not having the electoral college and only using the popular vote during voting periods they would feel they system is more efficient. One example is big States could make n tremendous impact on which candidate wins the election. These States have more people with more opinions that should be used during the time of the election for the president.Come of the problems with the Electoral college is not only do voters not vote for their president, Back in 1960" The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy co that n popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy". "In that some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast n deciding vote for whomever they please" That is not what we are promised NS n country. It States that the electoral college is supposed to cast n vote on what their state wants and what their state HNS chosen. That year the right to do so WNS taken any. Voting is n serious matter. Popular vote would clarify what each States popular favor is, who they went, and which candidate their vote WNS to be costed for.I hope with all the information that I have just provided you with above will help to show you that the popular vote isnt only what most people went its also the better choice.
