Whorl I stand on this issue is that those cars should not Beau made because mankind is already lazy enough as is. I remember for a song called In Tho Year 2525 tho writer of tho song is saying that in tho future you wont Food your BYOS because nobody will look at you, and that you wont Food your arms or your logs because some mo chino is doing that for you. As is oxidant with those most that it is mostly going all digital which I am also against. You I do Agnew it would help us in tho, tho long run financial, as said in tho first paragraph. And yo sit does still require tho driver to navigate through sticky situations, but tho fact still Romain that indopontant cars are not to Beau trusted by my standing point.Those cars do require constant Mackinac for upgrades and updates on existing roads and now roads to Beau put in its data base, which is just too pensive to Beau put to practical USO as said in tho third paragraph. Those cars and Beau program to do bad things just as if someone was driving tho car and can cause groat issues I say about paragraph four.So about this issue about if driverless cars should Beau out for everyone to USO, I will have to say no, they should not make those cars. Those cars cans crow up at any time, pardon my language. They cost too much and they can Beau program to drive like an actual person is behind tho wool and can drive tho passengers to their deaths.
