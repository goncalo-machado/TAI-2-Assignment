IN the Article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions like the Mona Lisa Smile.In the article it says that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgust, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry somethings or technology cant do that or some people cant do that at all and that is spring but what they call it is the "The FNCI Code" and the name sounds cool and makes means.Well the whole process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of all faces; all 44 major murals in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit." Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Beckman, Creator of FACS. Beckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Here is an example in the article 1. Raise your lips at the corner of your mouth.2. Then Squint your eyes slightly, to produce drinking at the corner of your eyes.3 Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes.According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.A renowned drama couch, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.
