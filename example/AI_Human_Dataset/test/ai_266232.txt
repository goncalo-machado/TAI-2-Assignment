 Here is a basic essay arguing whether the use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable or not:Many people always pet confused. Some people say that using the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is brilliant, while others say it is a terrible idea. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author talks about using this new technology. The Facial Action Coding System lets computers see what emotions people are feeling. For instance, if someone is happy, the computer will know they are happy by using this technology. I think it is valuable to use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it could help teachers understand their students better. If a teacher sees that a student is confused or unhappy, they can help that student and perhaps even change the way the student feels. However, I also think that using this technology can be scary because it gives too much information to the teachers about the students. The teachers could become obsessed with finding out if the students are happy or not, and that would not be Food for anyone. Overall, I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a cool invention, but it might be better to use it in some places and not in a classroom. Would you like me to continue?
