As a young man, I never imagined I would have the opportunity to travel the world, care for animals, and make a difference in the lives of others. But thats exactly what happened when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program in 1945.At the age of 18, I embarked on my first mission to Greece with my friend Don, caring for 335 horses. It was an experience like no other, and it opened my eyes to a whole new world. Over the next two years, I completed nine trips, more than any other seagoing cowboy, delivering animals to war-torn Europe and China.But it wasnt all work and no play. On board, we had leisure activities like poker games, singing, and even a makeshift rodeo. It was a unique experience that not only broadened my worldview but also influenced my later life. I had the opportunity to host international students and exchange visitors, which further deepened my understanding of different cultures.So, why should you join the Seagoing Cowboys program? Firstly, its an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of others. By delivering animals to areas affected by war and poverty, youll be helping to provide people with a source of food and livelihood. Its a chance to give back and make a positive impact on the world.Secondly, its a chance to experience new cultures and places. As a seagoing cowboy, I visited countries like Greece, Italy, and China, and I learned about their customs, traditions, and ways of life. It was an education that I could never have received in a classroom.Thirdly, its a program that will challenge you and push you out of your comfort zone. Caring for animals on a ship during a voyage can be difficult, but it will also teach you valuable skills like responsibility, hard work, and teamwork.Lastly, its a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. Who wouldnt want to ride the waves, breathe in the sea air, and watch the sunsets on the horizon? Its an experience that youll never forget, and one that will shape your life forever.In conclusion, joining the Seagoing Cowboys program was one of the best decisions I ever made. It was a chance to make a difference, experience new cultures, challenge myself, and have an adventure. If youre looking for a unique experience that will broaden your horizons and enrich your life, then I encourage you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You wont regret it.
