In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author explains both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The author talks about from what the driverless cars have in store from the areas the driverless cars need help on. In the end, I am more than sure I am against driverless cars.One reason why I am against the making of these cars are that the word "driverless" in the word driverless car, isnt true. The car is not one hundred percent driverless. The car will alert the driver when needed assistance. Such as heavy traffic, construction zones, and accident scenes. The narrator states, "In fact, none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless." As you can see, the car doesnt live up to its name.Another reason why I wouldnt approve driverless cars are that they arent as safe to a human being in control of wheel. Technology is not that advanced to where it doesnt have glitches and issues. It still does. Not saying us humans dont, but wouldnt you rather be in control intending of trusting a certain thing that is not one hundred percent accurate? Even traffic laws stated that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.In conclusion, driverless cars are not what the claim to be. Their not guaranteed driverless and they arent safe. From not even being real to their name to having issues. I hope I wont see a driverless car on the road anytime to see.
