Education is an important aspect of an individuals life that empowers them with knowledge and skills to make a living. Choosing a field of study can be challenging, especially when it comes to balancing interests and financial stability. Some people prioritize their interests, while others focus on acquiring skills that will lead to well paying careers. In my view, educational institutions should encourage students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers. This essay will provide reasons and examples to support my argument.Firstly, choosing a field of study that prepares one for a lucrative career ensures that they have financial stability. The cost of living is continually increasing, and having a stable income is essential in meeting ones needs. Studying in fields such as engineering, medicine, law, and business, increases ones chances of having a high paying job, which translates to financial security. For instance, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for lawyers was $126,930, while that of engineers was $81,440. Therefore, it is essential for educational institutions to encourage students to choose fields that offer financial stability.Secondly, choosing a field of study that prepares one for a lucrative career increases their future earning potential. Studying in fields that offer high paying jobs can lead to an increase in salary as one progresses in their career. A degree in medicine, for example, can lead to a well paying job as a doctor, but one can also specialize in a particular field, such as neurosurgery, and earn more. This applies to other fields such as law, engineering, and business, where one can specialize in a particular area and earn more. Therefore, educational institutions should guide students towards fields that offer the potential for career growth and increased earning potential.Thirdly, choosing a field of study that prepares one for a lucrative career helps to reduce student loan debt. Pursuing a degree can be expensive, and most students have to take out student loans to finance their education. Choosing a field that offers a well paying job after graduation can help one repay their student loans faster. According to the US news and World Report, graduates in high paying fields such as engineering and computer science, have the highest chances of repaying their student loans faster. Therefore, it is essential for educational institutions to guide students towards fields of study that offer high paying jobs and the potential to pay off student loan debt.In conclusion, educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers. Financial stability, increased earning potential, and reducing student loan debt are reasons why students should be guided towards these fields. Studying in fields such as engineering, medicine, law, and business, offer high paying jobs, and students should be encouraged to pursue them. Educational institutions should provide guidance and resources to help students make informed decisions about their choice of study. By doing this, students will be well equipped to make a living and contribute to the economy.
