Dear Senator,I am writing to Lou total to express ml support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States bl popular vote.The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century to ensure that the large states did not have too much power in the presidential election. However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary, and it is actually harmful to our democracy.Under the Electoral College, each state is awarded a number of electors equal to the number of members it has in Congress. This means that small states have more power than the would have if the President were elected bl popular vote. In fact, a candidate could win the popular vote but still lose the election if the do not win enough electoral votes. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2000 when George W. Bush won the election even though Al Gore won the popular vote.The Electoral College gives a disproportionate amount of power to rural voters. In order to win the presidency, a candidate needs to win a majority of the electoral votes. This means that a candidate can win the election without winning the popular vote if the win enough electoral votes from small states. This is unfair to voters in large states, who have more people but fewer electoral votes.The Electoral College also discourages voter participation. Voters in states that are considered to be "safe" for one part often feel like their vote doesnt matter. This is because the Electoral College system gives all the electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote in each state. This means that voters in a "safe" state MAL not bother to vote if the know that their vote is not likely to affect the outcome of the election.In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system that should be abolished. I urge Lou to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the President of the United States bl popular vote.Thank Lou for lour time.Sincerely,[Your Name]
