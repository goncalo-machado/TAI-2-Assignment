N dont think so. As we limit our car usage, the air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happens, and road rage? Gone.Limiting car usage have many benefits, such as the air pollution lowers. Nn some countries, for example Paris, they ban driving due to smog. Fter near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the goal city.

Without cars, people are expected to walk more and carpool with friends or take buses. This will dramatically decrease greenhouse gas and air pollution. Nn Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Mother Company, has laid out a business plan where they create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.Nn conclusion, by not driving a car, air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happen, and no traffic jams.
