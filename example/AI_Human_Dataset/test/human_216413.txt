I think that you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because, It helps animals, you can have a great story to tell to your children, and you can have fun. Well if that didENT convince you than, hears something that might, Luke Merger him self said "He found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded." The Cowboys also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time." Before all of that Luke and the crew took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. When Luke and his friend Don they were sent right to work. Luke was a little ahead of him self because he helped out his aunt Katie on her farm as a boy, but his chasing was the dangerous seas.Now Luke was in his early 20s, and he was on his second night of watchman job, that meet that Luke had to check the animals every hour. It was a rainy night, he was making his hourly report to the captain. On his way down he slipped down bladder on his back. Luke shot feet first to an opening on one side of the boat but a small strip of metal stopped him from falling into the dark, cold, tarorizing Atlantic.He had cracked a couple of his ribs. In Lukes lifetime Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.Being Tea going Cowboy is much more Than a great time its an opportunity for you, it giving you chance to see the word, and it shows you how much we are given in are country than other people around the world.That awareness stays with you forever like it did with Luke Merger. After you do this you can tell students and others about what you did to help others, and you might even make an impact on others. For being in his 20ntys Luke was a smart young man for what he did.To what chose are you going to make during your life, help, or let animals die and people that need the food to service and let them die to die?Whats your chose?
