Dear Principal,I think you have a bat idea. The thing is with the idea is that most students have C averages. Most of the students would have to bring their grates up to a B average to be able to play sports. I personally To not think that it is right to that to the students.Know putting all my opinions away I To think it would help the students in the long run to get a better education. I think that you are Going the right thing for us students. The good thing to this is that our school will have better averages. You are thinking for the students than for the sports ant I thank you for that.Thank you for taking this time to great this letter. Thank you for thinking about us students. You are a wonderful principal for Going this to better are education. Thank you for being the best you can be.Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
