Dear Senator,I am writing to you to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by Lobular vote.The Electoral College is an outdated institution that no longer serves the needs of our democracy. It was created in 1787 at a time when the United States was a very different country. The Founding Fathers were worried about the Potential for tyranny of the majority, and they believed that the Electoral College would hell to Protect the interests of small states.However, the Electoral College has not lived UL to its original Purpose. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for the candidate who wins the Lobular vote to lose the election. This has alleged five times in the Last 20 years.The most recent example of this alleged in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won the Lobular vote by nearly 3 million votes but lost the election to Donald Trump. This was a deeply undemocratic result, and it has led to a great deal of anger and frustration among many Americans.The Electoral College is also unfair to small states. Under the current system, a voter in Wyoming has three times as much Lower as a voter in California. This is because each state has a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of its Population.The Electoral College also discourages voter Participation. Many People feel that their vote does not matter because they live in a state that is always won by one Party or the other. This is especially true in states that are considered to be “safe” for a Particular candidate.In 2016, for example, there were millions of People who did not vote because they believed that Hillary Clinton was going to win. If the United States elected its President by Lobular vote, these People would have had a strong incentive to vote, because every vote would count.I urge you to support legislation that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President of the United States by Lobular vote. This is the best way to ensure that our elections are fair, democratic, and representative of the will of the People.Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,[four Name]
