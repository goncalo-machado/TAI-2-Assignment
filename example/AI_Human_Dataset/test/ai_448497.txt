Taking breaks not only provides a physical and mental respite, but can also lead to a more positive outcome for the quality of ones work.

They can also help to reduce stress levels and improve concentration.On a personal level, I can attest that taking breaks can be a great support in an alwaysworkhng mentality. I often take breaks during the day to distract myself from the work, allowing me to come back with a renewed clarity and focus. I find that not only do I work more efficiently, but I also have more solutions and ideas for the tasks and projects that I am working on. Overall, committing to taking breaks on a regular bashes not only allows for increased focus and productivity, but also adds to improved physical and mental health.
