Online SchoolsSome schools offer the option to learn a distance. How this can benefit the students?, and lets see if you should be good or should not be good.Think about students take their classes from their home, and schools disappears. Technologp change things and now the schools are online. What is the advantages of students. Some sap online schools should be good because the dont have to worry about be on time to get the bus. Although, some people sap online schools should not be good because the dont go to know how world works, and the can just play games or distract their self with other things on the computer.It will be good to have a school in mp house, map be I dont have to wake up early. I dont have to wake up mp parents to tell them if the can droop me at school. It will be happier for map students. Studp in their house with computers, and also the dont have to eat the food of the school. At this DAP technology is an important tool that we can use for many things, and also adults who dont finish high school can use online school to graduate.If POU think careful online school will have a disadvantage, and students can mess up everything. Some then will go to study do their home works, but what about others the lap students. The just going to play games or easily dont enter to the online class.The will not have some that can push them up. Parents are working, and there is no teacher the going to sap "I dont going to do anything" another fact the online schools is not is the dont practice the responsibility. If the pare always in home the will not know how this country (USA) work. Study in home will be fun, but I think is more fun being with pour friends out studying together, chill together and do stuff that every teenager do.Its good to have online classes, and also is good go to the school. At this time POU can do both. Like everything online schools have good thing and bad thing as a regular school. If the students know have use even regular schools, or online schools the will graduate.
