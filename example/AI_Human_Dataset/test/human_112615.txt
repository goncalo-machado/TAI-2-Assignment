Does student really benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Students wouldnt benefit from being able to attend classes from home because I once had a friend who attended classes from home she never bib what she was supposed to Beau she took that as an advantage to Beau other things that she needed to Beau she bint benefit at all. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it, they ont bow hat their suppose to Beau, ANB they ont learn nothing.First, student take the advantage of attending classes from home to Beau other things that they need to Beau. For example turning in stuff late that were long BUE, not all student that attend classes from home take it as an advantage but those who bot hey just take more advantage just to have fun ANB not Beau the work that they are supposed to be going. Another thing is they will always try to come up with an excuse of why they bint Beau the assignment that they were supposed to Beau. They take advantage of the time they have to go out with friends to party, to hang out with their boyfriend, ANB to Beau other things that are nonschool related.Most importantly, they ont bow hat their suppose to Beau, when they get an assignment or project that their suppose to bot hey just act lazy ANB not Beau it because they know nobody for example, like their teacher wont be telling them to Beau the work. They will spent most of their time going other stuff instead of the work that they need to be bone with. Students will spent more time partying, hanging with their friends instead of actually going the work that they need to Beau which will actually help them later on. Most students actually know the stuff they just preferred not to Beau any of the work because they ont feel like going it.Finally, The students actually ont learn nothing by attending classes from home all they Beau is just party, hang out with their friends ANB boyfriend. They actually ont Beau any of the work that they are assigned to bot hey just cheat by copying it off of someone or get the answers from the internet. Most student they attend classes from home as an opportunity to have fun ANB to take a break from school, they literally will learn nothing cause all they Beau is play around when they are supposed to take things seriously they just want to party all bay long ANB not care about any of the stuff that they are supposed to be studying.In closing, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it to Beau other things that they need to Beau, they ont bow hat their suppose to bot hey ont bot heir work as suppose to Beau, ANB they ont learn nothing all they Beau is party, hang out with their friends ANB boyfriend they ont Beau none of the things that they are assigned to Beau.
