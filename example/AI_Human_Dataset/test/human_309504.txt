I dont really think that it should be required to take community service, because people arent always the case of liter, pollutants, biohazards, etc. in their own community, however, if people would like to volunteer to help out in their community and get graded on it by the school then I would be open to the idea of that. People shouldnt be forced to do things they dont want to do. Thats the only thing I have against this. Even though it would be beneficial to the community. I would say let the kids that get detention and do bad staff help with the community, to give them something to do outside of the detention room. Students that are proven avid loiterers should be held responsible for their own actions. But also another reason why Im against this idea is that most cities a crew to drive around town, water plants, clean town monuments, pick JP liter, etc. this could potentially take away their jobs. A great reason why the idea is good is it helps give the students a since of responsibility, and helps them know what work is about at an early age. Plus it gives the school a reputation as being good and caring for the community. But that isnt always what its about and the students should have an option to. It would be great assistance to the community though, teaching students how to keep things the way they should stay, clean. And give them a since of respect to their own community. Right picture, Wrong idea. Now tutoring other students is another thing, students arent always open to the idea of helping other classmates with their work, but others are, again, being graded on volunteering would be fantastic for some helpful students.
