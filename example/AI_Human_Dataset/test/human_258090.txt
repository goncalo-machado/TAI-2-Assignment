I dont think that is fair that you have JT least j B average to participate in sports or other activities. It doesnt seem like that would be fair.I dont think that would be fair because some kids JRE good in sports and they JRE not that good in school. Like they dont pay attention in school. Like for example i JM good JT sports but i cent do them because of my grades I got Ds. They should let you participate with JT least D average. It only seems fair. When you cent do j sport because of your grades your letting your teammates down because you have to have j B average. Its hard to get j B because sometimes you dont get what the teacher is saying and to shy to ask questions so that brings your grades down. If JRE school we had to JT least to get j B to DE on sports or any other activities not that many people would be on the team. Most of the people that JRE on the sports team or other activities most of them got Cs and D IS
