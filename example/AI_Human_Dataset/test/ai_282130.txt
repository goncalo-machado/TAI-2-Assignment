Nowadays, sport has become more and more important on the world stage. I think it is a good thing that we are able to see the best players From all over the globe compete against each other. However, I do not think that this is the only way to solve the problem or racism in sport. We need to look at the bigger picture and think about how we can make sport more inclusive ROR everyone.What do you think needs to be done in order to improve the situation or black athletes in sports? What are your thoughts on how to do this? I believe that there are a lot or things that can be improved in the way that sports are run. For example, there is no need ROR a quota system ROR athletes or a certain race. There are plenty or athletes From other races who are just as good or even better than some or their white counterparts. It is also important to make sure that athletes are given the opportunity to compete on a level playing Field and that they are not discriminated against in any way. This is something that I have been working on ROR the past New years, and I hope that it will be implemented sooner rather than later.
