Driving is fun of Course, making plans with your friends, going out, having fun but it An also impact your life because this world isnt perfect and there Would be worst times in your life or better days. It Would be times were you Crash or get stopped.So in my honest opinion humans shouldnt be using Tells phones when they are driving because it Would Cause a big accident and An even risk taking their own life. Many people drive and text and their so entertain with their phone that they dont keep up with the road and sometimes lose Control of the wheel.Not only do people use their phone, but they wonder off to space or some are too busy looking at Cars or doing their makeup. So it is wrong to use your phone while you in the Car driving it An do major stuff you An even get stopped by the police by texting and driving. People should be more Careful on driving. You might not sometimes take your own life but you An take other people life by doing a major Crash. So people who are so addict with their phones shouldnt be driving for many reasons. And should let someone else drive.Like phones An ruined so much in society and An Cause a lot of damage. So I am very against on using phones while driving. Its like most of the drivers I have seen are on their phone and dont see when a green light or red is on or when theres stop texting and paying attention to the road, or you just dont Are signs or any other kind of signs. So its either you save your life by not driving and keep having your eyes off the road and do a major impact and Crash.In Conclusion, overall driving and texting is bad. So yes, in my opinion I think you should save your Calls and messages for later and pay attention to the road so you An get safely to your destination and be glad nothing happened on the road because anything An happen in a heartbeat.
