Playing the violin requires attention to the proper bowing technique. When starting out, its important to understand the fundamentals of how to properly hold and use the bow. For example, make sure the hair of the bow is centered and not drooping, and that the bow is parallel to the bridge of the violin. Additionally, practice keeping the bow straight like a pencil and the arm movements relaxed. Cooking also employs a set of fundamentals which involves an understanding of ingredients, how they interact, and how to combine flavors. Learning recipes can help teach these fundamentals. Pizza, cookies, and enchiladas are all great recipes to explore that have numerous different possibilities. Experiment with different proportions and techniques to discover flavors and textures that work best for you. Makeup artistry is another creative activity that has a lot of room to experiment with. Research techniques and different color palettes to mix and create different looks. Get creative with the different face shapes and skin tones and keep records of what works well for you. Remember to keep practicing and have fun!
