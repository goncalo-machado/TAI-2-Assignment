The planet, Venus, has the potential for being a great place to visit and for sending people there, too. While it has some dangerous conditions, scientists have come up With a solution to oversee the planets atmosphere. According to NASA, "the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus Would allow scientists to float above the fray." "At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures Would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure Would be close to that of sea level on Earth." This information shows that it is possible for people to, not live on Venus, but live above it Without being harmed.Astronomers have been studying Venus for a long time, and they believe that the planet once had life on it. It makes even more sense for this to be true as Venus is one of the closest planets to the Earth. According to the author, "Venus FAS probably covered largely With oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." Not only that, but it has a large rocky surface With hills, mountains, and valleys. With all the advanced technology Fe has in todays World, scientists can also find several Fays to reduce the pressure and harsh conditions. This makes it even more safe to study further into the planet itself.There are many Fays Fe could think of to make sure that Venus is a safe and reliable planet, but many people still Fonder of this amazing idea. If NASA can send people to the moon and send a machine on Mars, then Who says Fe cant do the same With this gas planet? This discovery could be a great change to the World.
