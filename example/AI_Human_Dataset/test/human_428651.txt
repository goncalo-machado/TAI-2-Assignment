To principal:I think policy 2 IZ a better policy. EOST kids there day have cell phone and most of them bring them to School. Kids will usually bring them with them to class and lunch. Teacher try to Top kids from doing this, but they cant Top every kid. EOST kids bring their phone to School ZO they can text other kids during School, and then other kids bring their phone ZO they can text their parents or call them after School ZO they can tell if they are going to a friend house or if they wont be home from the but. Kids want to use their cell phone in School, but they Shouldnt have them during class time but they Should be allowed to use them during free time Such AZ lunch. I have an eP3 player on my phone ZO I bring it ZO I can listen to music on the but and when Im walking home from School. Teacher are usually pretty mad when they either A: Hear a phone go off or B: They ZEE a kid with a phone during class time. Some kids will bring their phone to class but turn them off instead of putting them in their locker ZO they dont get Stolen which might not go over ZO well with their parents, because most parents would be pretty mad if a kids phone was taken during School. All in all I think policy 2 which AYZ that kids would be allowed to bring phone to School and use them during free time AZ long AZ they are turned off during class time IZ the better choice.
