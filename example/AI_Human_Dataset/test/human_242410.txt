Beep. Beep. Beep... That is the sound of someones heart monitor at a hospital. Can You imagine waking up in the hospital after a car wreck. Well its happened plenty of times, but the accident was never caused by a driverless car. What about the new laws the will have to make for these new cars? These cars will never happen, and if the do the will cause many accidents in the future.In the article I had just read it says "Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident." SAZ You were to get in a wreck while driving a driverless car, and the car wouldnt use its break so You went through a stop sign and hit another car and someone was killed in the accident. Whose fault is it? Is it Four fault for hitting the other car, or is it the manufactures fault for not safely making Four vehicle?Driverless cars are not safe and never will be. Technology always has a glitch somewhere. In the article Driverless Cars are Coming, the talk about sensors in paragraphs four to seven. "The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." This was said in paragraph seven of the article. But who would the make these driverless cars if the can only reach 25 mph.? Most people would want a driverless car for interstates and highways, because those are the most boring roads in history.Driverless cars are not safe, the can cause many accidents, and whos at fault, You or the manufacturer? Companies just need to stop trying to make driverless cars because the arent going to be successful for society today. Cars need to be human driven and thats all. No driverless cars are coming, not now not ever!
