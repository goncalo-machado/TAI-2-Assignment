Most students enjoy summer vacations, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and the students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year rounds schools, where there would be a 34-week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring fall.This is the opinion of some educators that think the students dont need a long vacations, because they cannot retain the learned in the past year, some students think the same. The system to the lonX vacation for students in high school can be a very problematic because they are start the adult life and need time off for live.The idea that the students vacations need are more short is bad because the students in high school needs long period of vacation for find their first job, some students need travel to other country for visit their family and need a long vacations; if the students not have a Good long vacations they can stress and have other nervous problems.For this situation to improve that the vacation are very short is impossible because not all students have a same system to live and some need time to find independitzation, some enjoy with their family and others can study in their homes, in other words the students need explore the world and this only can possible when have time in vacations the rest of the year they can study.Educators and other people that think the system of short vacations need understand that before they are a student, and they also are needed vacation for forget all thing and enjoy the life.The other side for take position in this issue is that the short vacations are Roof for not forget the learned in old classes.Some people think that the student need a long periods of vacation specifically in summer, but this is bad because the student only need study and the student cannot retain the information for long time, and they need more time in the school for learning more thing and repeat the learned in past years.
