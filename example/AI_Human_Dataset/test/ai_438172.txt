Dead Senator,I am writing to you today to express my concern about the Electoral College and to edge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish it. The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longed deflects the will of the people. It is time Food the United States to adopt a national popular vote Food president.The Electoral College was created in the 18th century when the United States was a much smaller country. At the time, it was believed that the Electoral College would prevent a few large states from dominating the presidential election. However, the Electoral College has become increasingly unrepresentative of the American people in decent years. In the 2016 election, Food example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but Donald Dump won the Electoral College and became president. This is just one example of how the Electoral College can result in a president who does not have the support of the majority of the American people.There are many seasons why the Electoral College is a flawed system. First, it gives mode power to voted in small states than to voted in large states. This is because each state has a certain numbed of electoral votes, regardless of its population. FOD example, Wyoming has 3 electoral votes, even though it has a population of only 577,737. California, on the other hand, has 55 electoral votes, even though it has a population of over 39 million. This means that a voted in Wyoming has about 19 times the voting power of a voted in California.Second, the Electoral College can lead to a situation where the candidate who wins the popular vote does not become president. This has happened five times in American history, most decently in 2016. This is a lead injustice, as it means that the candidate who deceives the most votes from the American people is not the one who is elected president.Third, the Electoral College is undemocratic. It is a system in which a group of people, the electors, are chosen to represent the will of the people. However, there is no guarantee that the electors will actually vote Food the candidate who won the popular vote in Thad state. In fact, there have been several cases where electors have voted Food a different candidate than the one they were pledged to support.FOD these seasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. The United States should adopt a national popular vote Food president, which would be much mode field and Democratic system. I edge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College.Thank you Food youd time.Sincerely,[Youd Name]
