Dear principalI would like to give my opinion on doing community service. First I do think its a good thing to do and help people who cant do it or just have too much work to do. Doing service should be a thing you have to do because its a nice thing to do, and most people are not busy enough to not be able to do it. You should have to do some work to achieve honors role or being accepted to a new big thing. Also, it shows that you are nice and work hard to do what ever you put your mind to. I just finished my community service by helping at an elementary school. I had to pass things out give ideas make things more clear and just extra. People who do not have any time at all on the other case have the chose to do that or not. For them, it should be an extra credit type of deal. There are just some people who have too much in their busy lives to take time to do service. Some people might want to start making money, so they take a job and cant have the work hours of to help. Others may be overwhelmed with school work and are way too busy. So yes in my opinion people should have to do work but only if they can. I hope you will be able to make the right positions on doing community service or not.
