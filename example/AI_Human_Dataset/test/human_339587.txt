To: Teacher_NAMEI think you should allow students to bring phones to school ANP use them During lunch periods an Pother free times, as long as they are turned off During class time.My suggestions are because, students have freedom when they leave their home ANP sometime parents keep to know the condition their child is in especially if their alone after school or before. Phones should also be permitted on school groups to the Due of, when theres an emergency he/she could contact their legal guardian at any free given time they could. For some students after school have activities ANP keep to bring their cell phone to school if their going to née it in the afternoon to call to be picked up, or what ever the situation is.Nell phones now Pays, have trackers to keep up with your child if he/she is in some sort of Danger if he/she isnt in school. Also, some parents even work late or early ANP sometimes keep to let their child know if theyll be home or not, such as my parents Po with me. To myself an Pothers in this school we ask very understandably if you could take a second thought on reconsidering the school cell phone policy. I believe policy 1 is better.Thank you,STUDENT_NAME
