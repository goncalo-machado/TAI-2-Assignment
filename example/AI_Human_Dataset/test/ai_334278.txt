Dear Senator,I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to you today to address what has become an imperative question for a democratic society like ours Should we keep the Electoral College or switch to the popular vote for selecting the President of the United States? Our Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between having Congress and the masses choose the President (Office of the Federal Register). However, criticizers of the system, like Bradford Plume, argue that the system is old and arbitrary (The Indefensible Electoral College). Others, like Judge Richard A. Poster, defend the system for its carefully laid principles and practicality (In Defense of the Electoral College). Opponents claim that the Electoral College rejects the democratic principle of one man, one vote, and has continually posed threats of disaster factor like the debacle of 2000, where the person with a higher vote count did not end up as the President, and scenarios where electors may not vote for whom they pledged (The Indefensible Electoral College). However, if we critically view our political system, calling for a direct democracy may not be the optimal solution either.The Electoral College presents a more balanced method as it gives leverage to smaller states. The system demands national appeal from a candidate rather than just targeted campaigning (In Defense of the Electoral College). Under a popular vote, candidates might only campaign in highly populated regions, often neglecting the interest of voters in less populated areas, diminishing the essence of representation that lies at the core of democracy. Furthermore, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcomes and prevents complicated situations such as the runoff elections, as Judge Poster rightly pointed out (In Defense of the Electoral College). Simply shifting to popular vote without acknowledging this issue could lead to more complications.While its clear that the system has its concerns, its crucial to remember that our present democratic process was established over hundreds of years. If popular vote is viewed as a more democratic approach, perhaps we could consider reformations of the current system rather than a complete overhaul. A system where electors are allocated proportionally in each state, akin to Maine and Nebraska’s “proportional representation,” could be an intermediate solution to reconcile the critics of the Electoral College while still keeping some safeguards of the current system intact (Office of the Federal Register).Our nation is built on democratic ideals, and any changes must be wellthoughtout and presented to the citizens for discussion. Ultimately, it should be our shared ambition to make every vote count and the presidential election process more equitable and transparent.Thank you for considering my view on this matter.Sincerely,[Your Name]
