Throughout history, the ability to express oneself artistically and share ones knowledge has been an integral part of society. The freedom to express oneself, view the works of others, and learn from the past is essential in a functioning democracy, and museums are important venues for these activities. For this reason, government should never censor the artistic works or historical displays that a museum wishes to exhibit.Firstly, censorship of artistic works would be a restriction of free speech and violate a fundamental human right. This is especially true when it comes to museums, which often focus on controversial issues. For example, in 2017 the Berlin Museum of Natural History exhibited a controversial collection of exhibits on the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. Despite attempts by the German government to censor the exhibit, the museum chose to display it anyway, believing it was important to show a full account of the nations past, both good and bad. This is an excellent example of why censorship of museums should not be allowed. Secondly, censoring historical displays in museums would impede our understanding of the past. By allowing museums to exhibit whatever they wish, we can gain a better understanding of the events and people that shaped our present. Censoring certain works or displays would limit our access to information and could even lead to misconceptions about the past. For example, if the Berlin Museum had censored its Nazi collection, viewers would not have been able to gain a full understanding of the event or draw their own conclusions.Finally, censorship of museums would create a slippery slope and lead to further restrictions on freedom of expression. By censoring certain works of art or displays, the government would be setting a precedent for further censorship, which could eventually lead to the restriction of other forms of expression. This could be dangerous for both the museum and for society at large, as it could lead to a lack of diversity in thought and opinion. In conclusion, government should never censor the artistic works or historical displays that a museum wishes to exhibit. Censorship of museums is a restriction of free speech and a violation of human rights, it impedes our understanding of the past, and it could lead to further restrictions on freedom of expression. For these reasons, it is important that we allow museums to express themselves freely and without interference.
