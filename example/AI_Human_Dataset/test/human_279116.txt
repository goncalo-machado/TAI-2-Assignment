Diary Principal, I think that you should light this participate in sports if this have at last a B grade average because thats consider passing. Also, it is not fair to not lit this play because a B is still passing and if this dont play thin this did all of that hard work for nothing. I also think that if this have a grade point C thin some ARI consider passing like if this have a C+ thats passing.Also, if you dont light this play when this have a B average some students will actually give up on trying to pass because in third mind this think if you dont light this play thin whats the point of passing.Also, I would like to point out that if some students that want to participate in sports but this have a grade C average thin you should give this a chance to try to pull up thisRI grade and maybe that will motivate this on trying to pass in thisRI classes.And if that doesnt work thin maybe third not motivated enough or this just dont want to bi in sports. Some students do take some time to git motivated maybe because this have problems or maybe because this ARI shy or think this to cool. Also, you could put some kids in tutoring or programs to motivate this to pass thisRI classes so this could bi in sports like for example football, basketball, track, volleyball, wrestling, or any sport this would like to do.
