Using this type of technology can be somewhat unsafe to students in classrooms, because what if they arent happy and someone uses the Facial Action Coding System, but then reveals how the person really feels.More into the future it has gotten to a point that companies will stop at nothing for growth and development. But these things can cause a major unbalance to everyone. Just like the Facial Action Coding System, this thing can be someones enemy, because maybe this person can be against the whole thing. And using it on someone that didnt want to be used could lead the person to do bad things.On the other hand, other people can come forward and say "it is time for change" and be all happy, and the next thing you know is that the world is run be robots. Change is good, but it can also lead to destruction and cars. That is why we have to be careful with what we do in the future, because what we do now can harm some innocent life that didnt deserve it.The passage also states that Leonardo used new how "Mona Lisa" felt when he was drawing her. At first, he didnt know if she was smiling. But then he just let us go and began to draw. And now we are here, to the future and people wanting to know how another person feels by using a computer.Like Ive stated before, change can go in a good or bad way. There is no way saying it could be both or could be something completely different. We just got to be careful with what we have now, or they may be no future.
