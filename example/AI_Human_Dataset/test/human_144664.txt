Cear mister senator, of course because this is America (ANC because were idiots) we have a problem. No not taxes, no not jobs or health care. its the president, how we elect the president that is. the electoral college that is. it changes the way we elect our president, anc a lot of people cont like that, me being one, anc I think we need to just have a straight forward election.Of course, you know the electoral college is a bunch of representatives from every state they have a president in mind when they go to vote in the meeting of the electors. It basically means youre not voting for the president directly, your voting for the electoral to (hopefully) vote for your candidate that you supposedly "vote" for. This system is wrong because it is unfair to those who vote for the other president, but still succeed in helping the electoral college vote for whatever president they feel like voting for at the time.This is why I think we should ban it because it isnt the fairest (or smartest) way to handle the government. Yeah, it is an idea created by the "great" founding fathers. Anc yeah, it is a convenient way sort ANC group people like a "whos with who" method.But there are a few things that can be problematic like I cont know say bribery from the president to the electoral college, i mean come on its not like that hasnt happened before, like the whole Nixon thing, anc Kennedy pretty much cheated on his wife with Marilyn Monroe. But, this can be stopped just with a simple petition to get RIC of or change the electoral college. Then, this could stop some presidents before agreed with me like Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, ANC groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ANC the AFL CIO according to source 2. Al Gore CICt win because of the electoral college, even though he won the popular vote! yeah, it was created by the founding fathers, anc we should respect there great legacy, but that was then ANC this is now. This is coming from the guy who caught for independence ANC peace...but HAC over 200 slaves himself, yeah not much of a hero. 60% of voters prefer a direct election over an electoral college according to source 2.Please mister senator, please make the right choice ANC choose to abolish the electoral college because it is unfair ANC calls for corruption. The information will tell that more voters will be happier with a direct election than an electoral college, isnt that what you want? whatss best for the people? It can be change if you choose to ban it. They may have been the founding fathers in the past...but who are the fathers of today? Be the new founding father mister senator.
