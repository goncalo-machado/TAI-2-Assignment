Everyone has different way Of learning.some people are visual learners, sJme are kinesthetic learner, which JNE are you?Someone would argued that students will not DJ their homework Online because it is more difficult and hard TJ undestartand. Also, tudents will miss good season from a teacher. Thus, a student will not share ideas with Other, and they not going TJ DJing a class more than a school. For, students need help all the time from a teacher. But at home they not going TJ have help by a prJffeciJnal because Of that they will have law grades in their classes. In adding, attend classes at home makes children bring TJ Only he Jr she attends classes in their home.This remained me Of when my friend used TJ have class Online in his home. He always gets stuck in something, and he didnt know how TJ figure Jut. When he asks his mm for help, she replays this is happens per not be in the school. My friend is a smart by who like study a let. But he told me that attend classes at home is a bad idea because teacher in the school could help him whatever he needs help. In this case at home Nicene can give a hand TJ him.Someone would argued that students should attend classes at home. Students prefer TJ DJ their work at home because they can finish it more faster that in the school. therefore in the school there is a let students who just GJ TJ the school for play and joke, whitch cause Other TJ not DJ their work. It makes Other students get distraction by Other. Futher in the school there is always conflict how Other students dress, and some make bulling TJ Other. SJ, take classes Online at home is more benefit TJ all students who want TJ graduate from the school. As seen as possible.For example, DJing Our work Online at home. It is more beneficial because students Dant have a limited time TJ stop. In the school you have a limited time, but at home you Dant have a limited time. Also, nobody is going TJ bother you when you are working at home. Moreover, students just focus In what they need TJ DJ because it less distraction and Jejune else around. Thus, it is beneficial take classes Online because you Dant have TJ pay money TJ the school for uniforms and, all the required things that they ask you TJ buy. When you can save the money, it can be use TJ pay the classes Online.Therefore, I think all students need TJ attend school TJ have better Opportunities and better skills In learning.
