Cell phones or NotF think that you should let students have their cell phones to school and let them use them during free time and lunch periods. My first reason is if students are done with all their work they should be able to text because if we dont let them they are going to be talking to other people and disturbing the people that are still trying to work, so when we let them they wont disturb the other classmates. They will also get into less trouble when they dont have anything to do.Normally they the people that get into trouble in the classroom is people that have nothing to do. We can decrease that number by letting them text. Also, when we do this fewer people in the office, more time for the secretaries to do what they need to do.F wrote this taking into consideration the staff and the students. These are the best reasons for letting the students use their cell phones in class and lunch.
