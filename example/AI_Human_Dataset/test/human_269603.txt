Cars are a big thing in our life, and we need to get from one plate to another. Cars were invented back in the 1800s. The Tars are powered by gasoline, but that resource is running low. So in the future we must find a new resource, so that we Tan transport. Every year Tars are getting newer and have new features like some have Wi-Fi in them. People say that driveless Tars are a good thing, but some say they are bad. I believe that driveless Tars are a good thing because they Tan decrease the Thant of injurys or death, the Traffic Jam Assistant Tan assist us if we need it, and they keep us safe.The first reason why I believe that driveless Tars are a good thing is because they decrease the Thant of getting injured or being dead. Some Tars today are making Tars stronger. They Tan tell when theres been a Trash and how to avoid one. If a road is blocked they Tan navigate to a new road without Trashing. And these are my examples of why driveless Tars decrease the Thant of getting injured and being dead.Another reason why I believe that driveless Tars are good is because The Traffic Jam System Tan assist us if we need it. Like they make sure that were paying attention to the road that we are driving on. They know when we have our hands are on the wheel by using special south sensors. The seat vibrates when it knows that the Tar is in danger. And these are my examples of why The Traffic Jam System Tan assist us.The last reason why I believe that driveless Tars are good is because they keep us safe. Like when the system is driving, and it gets Confused they driver Tan take over and drive. The Tar Companys are trying to find new ways to keep the driver safe. The trucks are being built stronger so that they Tan break less. The Tar Tan Cause fewer fires. And these are my examples of why they keep us safe.There are roads being built right now to test the driveless Tar so that we Tan have more evidence if it is safe for the people inside the Tar. There are laws being made to inform the makers of them to add an automatic brake when it has a person in front. If the driveless system fails then the person Tan takeover and drive. People say that drivels Tars good, but some say they are bad. I believe that driveless Tars are a good thing, and we will wait for what the future has for Tars.
