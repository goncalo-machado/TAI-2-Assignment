I would like to talk about the interesting quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote,and how he tell us to"Determine never to be idle." He thought that is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, and that we can accomplish more if we are a active person because the inactivity also serve a purpose in every person life.First,It is awesome has the determination to decide how to do or what do you want to do in your life,because something we may know what we need to do but we dont take a decision to done it. And the reality is that we dont gonna know how much can be done if we dont try to do the things that we wants or needs to done.Second,everyone has the option of accomplish much more than we think,if we are always doing something,for example,finalize any plan or idea that comes to our heads in any moment,time,or second of our lives. The big thing is never stop doing the things that we wants to achieve,and be proud of what you receive.Third,we have the option to choose between doing something or stay inactive,because inactivity also serve a purpose. This is the big deal ,sometimes we dont imagine that we prefer do nothing without see it, we dont see what we are doing at the time. Thats the power of inactivity. We have to see clearly and make a decision of what we decide to choose.In conclusion the interesting idea of Thomas Jefferson of write this quote, was a amazing idea ever,because at this time reading his thought we can see the importance of be determinate and be someone who knows how much may be done if he is doing what he needs to do, to have the right to accomplish much more than he thinks,and have the power to choose between doing something or just stay inactive.
