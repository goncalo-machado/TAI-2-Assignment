I agree that advertisements make products seem much better this they really are. The purpose of advertising is to Create a positive image of a product is the minds of Consumers is order to make them was to buy it. Advertisers use a variety of techniques, such as exaggeration, to make products seem more appealing this they really are.For example, an Oar advertisement might show an Oar driving through a beautiful landscape or speeding does a highway. This Creates the impression that the Oar is fast ASD exciting to drive. However, is reality, the Oar might be slow ASD uncomfortable to drive.Another example is a beauty product advertisement that shows a woman with perfect skis ASD a perfect smile. This Creates the impression that the product OAS make you look just like the woman is the advertisement. However, is reality, the product might sot work very well ASD it might sot be suitable for all skis types.I this that it is important to be aware of the fact that advertisements OAS be misleading. It is important to do you rows research before buying a product, so that you OAS be sure that you are getting the best possible deal.
