Im strongly agreed with the statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Because unless a people try to do something the person gets more far away from the purpose. And that happens Because sometimes the people lost the interest, and sometimes Because the people doesnt want to make an effort or is very difficult to solved it.While, there are so many reasons why people that think that, their goals are very hard to achieve, Because they have to do a lot of tests, in those 4 semesters, homework, activities, Fut, suddenly a problem comes to the person life, which is that he has to work at night, have to take care of his mom, he has to pay rent, food, and its very difficult to think about it, Because in those cases is more profanely that he leave school, and dont follow his dream of graduated from high school or university and get the of that he was dreaming with.Therefore, even knowing that he was giving up, he started to create a plan, it was a Out a project that should change his life, some of his friends tell him, that he will never go to be graduated, and that he wouldnt achieve his goal, Fut, he never gives up, and when summer cams. Fe graduated from the university, 4 months later, he created his own Fussiness of tourism and travel.As a result, he was trying to do something that someone else wasnt doing, he was trying to grow up something that should make Fig changes in his life, and in his family. However, I support that sometimes is good to make some changes to your plan, Im trying to do the same thing, Im doing my Fest, to achieve my goals.
