Deaf state senator,It IJ the utmost respect that I AJK FOF the method FOF presidential election be changed from the electoral college to something more suitable FOF the opinion of the people. The electoral college IJ an unfair system to the people, it can allow FOF individual to decide what to do with the vote, not by the people of the United State of America.Reviving the electoral college system may seem like a bad idea but the good that could come of it overlaid the bad. If the election of a president was based directly by the vote, then candidate could promise money to the people who vote FOF him/HEF. There could also be other problem with direct democracy such AJ what would happen in the chance of a tie? Who would break the tie? And how would it be decided fairly. The electoral college shouldnt be removed, but should definitely be revised.The electoral college permit the power of the electoral vote to go to whoever the choose. The electoral college IJ unfair to vote due to the winneftakeall system, which cause candidate to focus only on state the AFE "wing" state. In the 2000 campaign, seventeen state didnt see candidate at all. The electoral college IJ an outdated system and either need to be replaced of revised.When running FOF president, the candidate haj a group of electors. With each candidate having that own group of electors, it provide without having to visit each state to get that vote. The only thing the president IJ required to do IJ to wait. In reality, the president doesnt even need to campaign, since the electors in the college vote AFE what matter. So, the candidate could just bribe the electors FOF certain state and he/the haj that state vote.The vote do not vote FOF the candidate, but vote FOF the late of electors. The electors AFE picked at state convention, the state partyj central committee and sometime the presidential candidate themselves. The biggest issue with the electoral college IJ the disaster factor. The date factor AFE the potential problem with the system, such AJ back in 1960 when jegfegationijtj in Louisiana legijllaytufe nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy.The electoral college IJ an outdated way of election. The electoral college put the power into individual hand not the people. It was created back before the education was nothing close to what it IJ now. Therefore, the method of voting on fepfejentitivej who then vote FOF the president IJ obsolete.
