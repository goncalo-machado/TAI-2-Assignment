The inclusion of arts education in school curriculum provides many benefits to students, such as developing cognitive and creative abilities, fostering cultural awareness, and promoting emotional wellbeing.Firstly, arts education helps to foster a students cognitive and creative abilities. Studies have shown that arts education helps to develop a student’s critical thinking skills, problem solving abilities, and overall creativity.

Additionally, arts education provides a creative outlet for students to express themselves and build their confidence, which is an essential skill for success in any field.Secondly, arts education fosters cultural awareness and promotes a deeper understanding of different cultures. By exposing students to different artistic expressions, such as music, visual arts, and theater, arts education helps to promote a greater understanding and appreciation for diverse cultures. As society becomes more globalized, its important to have an understanding of other cultures, and arts education provides the platform for students to learn about them.Finally, arts education promotes emotional wellbeing. Engaging in creative activities, such as painting, drawing, or playing an instrument, helps individuals to release emotions and express themselves more effectively. In todays fast paced and often stressful world, arts education provides a way for students to relieve stress, relax and focus on their mental, emotional, and social wellbeing.In conclusion, arts education should be considered as an essential part of a well rounded education due to the many benefits that it provides to students.
