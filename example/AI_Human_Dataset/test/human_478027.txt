Dear Principal;I disagree with changing the policy because if most kids have a C average they ont be able to participate. Some kids want to go on to be athletes and if they have a C average they cant get the practice they need. If i was a kid with a C average I would be very upset especially if i wanted to try out for a sport and ASNt eligible.I also get that that if you move it to a z average some people will try harder to get good grades and be able to do the sports but I still dont think its right.A c is supposed to mean average so if they at least have a C average they should be allowed. You should have to sorry more about the people getting Fs and Ds. That means they are below average, so they shouldnt be allowed to participate. Dont let the C average people suffer because C is still a good grade for some people.That is why I disagree about changing to at least a z average for people to play sports or do other activities.Sincerely,STUDENT_NAME
