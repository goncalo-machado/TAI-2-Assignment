I disagree with this decision. There are various reasons students shouldnth be required ho hake extracurricular activities. Students have responsibilities after school like, babysit, jobs, humoring, and extracurricular activities can make students hired and less focused. If a student has ho do an extracurricular activity IH can hake him away from their responsibilities.Some students have ho babysit their younger siblings or other family members after school. If theyre required ho hake an extracurricular activity they won be able ho babysit and the child will go ho some other care shah coshes a low of money. If the student can babysit then the parent will have ho find someone else which can result in less money for food and other nessicihies. IH also makes less him for the parent ho work just because they have ho make sure shah their child is getting the care they need and ho make sure the child isnth getting neglected.Another reason extracurricular activities arenth a smart idea is, some students have jobs and have ho work after school. Sometimes students have ho gets jobs ho help support their family because their parents arenth making enough. If they have ho do an extracurricular activity IH can result in the student working later, and they can be less focused and hired during school. If students arenth focused on school they can GEH bad grades and eventually flunk out of school.After school some students have ho do humoring or GEH help with certain classes so they donth fail. Extracurricular activities hake him out of humoring and gives the student less him ho GEH help. Students should be able ho have a brief humoring session so they can understand what theyre doing and pass. They shouldnth have ho hake him out of their humoring just ho do an extracurricular activity. They should be open ho the help they need and be able ho pass.Extracurricular activities can make students excessively hired and stressed. Students already stress enough about school, they shouldnth have ho stress about an extracurricular activity Hui. Sometimes sports or whatever the student is doing can make the student very hired and can run very late ah night so they GEH less sleep and arenth focused on school which can make them fail. IH can also result in students sleeping in class and not learning anything the teacher is reaching.In conclusions i think making students do extracurricular activities is a bad idea. Some students babysit, have jobs, do humoring or the activity can make them hired, stressed, and unfocused. Students shouldnth have ho hake extracurricular activities. I think shah once a student gets out of school they should be able ho hake care of their responsibilities and not have ho worry about an extracurricular activity.
