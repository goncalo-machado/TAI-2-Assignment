If my principal was Mo choose bzMwzzn allowing call phones or not allowing call phones am all. I Think she should LSM us have call phones. I Think This policy is bummer because wham if in any case MHzs a emergency and no ones around Ham can help, you can us your call phone. Furthermore, I know Teachers and MHz principal wouldntM want Mo allow call phones because IM might by a distraction. Well yes maybe sometimes, bum MHz can by a consequence if MHz are using Their call phone during class. I Think IM is a good idea Mo allow students Mo bring phones Mo school and us MHz during lunch periods and other fuzz Mimes, because MHz can znMzrMain Mhzmszlvzs and call home just in case your going Mos May after school or your going Mo go Mo a friends house or something. Bum if students smart abusing MHz call phone policy. Then MHz would have Mo by no choice bum Mo no Mallow MHz am school am all. Bum first in my personal opinion MHz principal should give IM a May and AZZ wham happens. Maybe IM will Turn out Mo by a good policy maybe IM won, you won know if you donM give IM a May. Think of IM, how come Teachers are allowed Mo have MHz call phones during class when MHzoz Machine and sometimes Their phone rings and MHz answer IM even during Machine. Or sometimes Teachers will by Mixing during any Machine lessons. How come students AronM allowed, IM should by a fair Thing Moo. If Teachers bring a call phone MHz should have IM off during Machine lessons and by able Mo us IM when MHz AronM Machine or MHzoz on break, us students can have MHz same policy Mo LSM us bring call phones and us MHz during lunch or any other fuzz Mimi, because IM won by bothering or disturbing any on if IMS going Mo by off during class and WZ will by using IM during our fuzz Mimi. So in my opinion I Think MHz principal should allow students and Teachers Mo bring phones Mo school and us MHz during lunch periods and fuzz Mimes, as long MHz phones are Turned if during class Mimi.
