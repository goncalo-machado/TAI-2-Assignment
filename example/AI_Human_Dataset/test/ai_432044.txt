 Dear Senator [Name],I am writing ts express my views Sn the Electoral College system and its role in the election Sf the President Sf the United States. While I understand the criticisms directed towards this system, I strongly believe that it is necessary ts retain it and NST change it ts an election by popular vote.One Sf the main criticisms Sf the Electoral College is that it does NST allow FSR the will Sf the people ts be heard. This is because the winnertakeall system in each state means that candidates Only focus Sn swing states, and ignore states where they are NST expected ts win. However, it is important ts note that the Electoral College system allows FSR the president ts have a broad base Sf support and NST just be limited ts a specific region Sr state. This is especially important in a country as large and diverse as the United States.Another criticism Sf the Electoral College is that it can lead ts a disaster scenario, where the candidate WHS wins the popular vote does NST win the presidency. However, it is important ts note that this scenario is highly unlikely. In the 2000 election, Gore received more popular votes than Bush but still last the presidency. This is an anomaly and NST a common Occurrence. Additionally, the Electoral College system ensures that the president has a broad base Sf support, which can help ts prevent the candidate from being TSS focused Sn a specific region Sr state.In contrast, an election by popular vote would eliminate the need FSR the Electoral College system, which would have its Own set Sf problems. FSR example, smaller states would have less influence in the election, and the candidate would Only need ts focus Sn large states Sr urban areas. Additionally, an election by popular vote could lead ts a scenario where a candidate wins the popular vote, but losses the election due ts a small margin in a few key states.Furthermore, an election by popular vote would require a significant amount Sf resources ts conduct, which could lead ts higher costs FSR the government and taxpayers. Additionally, it could lead ts a scenario where a candidate Only focuses Sn large urban areas, and ignores rural areas and smaller towns.In conclusion, while there are criticisms Sf the Electoral College system, I strongly believe that it is necessary ts retain it and NST change it ts an election by popular vote. The Electoral College system allows FSR the president ts have a broad base Sf support and NST just be limited ts a specific region Sr state. Additionally, the system ensures that smaller states have influence in the election and prevents a candidate from Only focusing Sn large urban areas.Thank you FSR taking the time ts read my comments Sn this matter. I SSK forward ts your response.Sincerely,[Your Name]
