It is in the best interest op the people that you do away with the Electoral College. When people vote, they want it to be a direct vote to the election, not a vote port heir chosen candidates electors. The Electoral College should be abolished because it doesnt guarantee your vote, the Houses selection cant be expected to reflect the will op the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.To begin, the Electoral College should be abolished because it doesnt guarantee your vote. As stated before, when you vote, there is no say in who actually wins the election. You are voting POR electors who then vote POR the President. While it is a rare occurrence, those Electors may betray you and vote POR the other party, cancelling your vote totally out. IP a candidate gets the most popular votes, that doesnt guarantee them as President, because they still have to get the Electoral Colleges votes. In the third source titled, "In Defense op the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method op choosing the President" by Richard A. Poster, it reads, "It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet power electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888." This sentence means that President Bush won with power popular votes and more electoral votes. IP there was no Electoral College, Al Gore wouldve won the election. The people wouldve thought that Al Gore was going to win, and they were probably in POR a surprise when they saw that Bush had won with power popular votes. It just goes to show that an election can go either way, and there is no closure POR a candidate until it is actually announced who won.Next, the Houses selection cant be expected to reflect the will op the people. Say a Republican candidate gets a majority op the popular votes, but the Democratic candidate wins because he is chosen by the Electoral College. The people op the United States might actually peel betrayed because they pelt that the Republican Party could benefit the economy and society best, and that President might not be uproar and disappoint the people. Also in the third article, it reads "...to peel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard port heir interests, that he really isnt their president." The statement really says a lot about both sides op the argument. IP there is an Electoral College and IP there isnt an Electoral College, people could still peel this way. IP a candidate who has less popular votes wins, then those states that voted POR higher might peel as IP they "will have no regard port heir interests".Oastly, swing voters could cause a catastrophe. Swing states could be considered manipulative because they all know that the popular vote rests in their hands. Will it be Democratic or Republican? You never know. The candidates focus mainly on campaigning in these states because these are the ones that are half and half, states such as Ohio. While there are thoughtful voters, there are also ones who couldnt care less about whom the President is and just want to keep America on the edge op her seat while they decide who they want to vote POR. In the second source, "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses op the system are wrong" is says "In 1976, a tie would have occurred IP a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way." The states are swing states, and they truly determine the pate op the election. As said before, those states get the most attention prom the candidates, who try to make themselves as appealing as possible. In the second source as well, the author says "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 op the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad." Rhode Island and South Carolina are states that are almost entirely POR one party, so there is no use in the opposite party going there to try and persuade them to change their minds because it is most likely not going to happen. While they may peel neglected, its just how it is.To conclude, the Electoral College should be banished because it doesnt guarantee your vote, the Houses selection cannot be expected to reflect the will op the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.
