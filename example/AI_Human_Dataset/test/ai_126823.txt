While there are valid arguments for both the Electoral College and election by popular vote, the Electoral College provides several key benefits that we must consider before making any changes. The arguments below demonstrate why the Electoral College system should be maintained.Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, president Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote even though he only secured 51.3 percent of the popular vote. This discrepancy showcases how the Electoral College system can prevent a prolonged dispute over the election outcome. Additionally, due to the winnertakeall method, a very slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral vote victory. This adds stability to the system and prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.Secondly, the Electoral College fosters the notion that the president serves as the leader of the entire nation, rather than being solely the representative of the majority. The requirement for transregional appeal ensures that each presidential candidate must cater to the needs and concerns of voters in different regions. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from winning, the Electoral College encourages candidates to consider the interests of citizens from various parts of the country, making them more likely to be successful presidents who serve the nation as a whole.Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, thereby engaging with a wider range of voters across the country. This system ensures that the most thoughtful voters, typically found in tossup states, have a significant say in deciding the election outcome. By doing so, the Electoral College promotes an election process where candidates invest time and resources in campaigning across different regions, allowing for a more inclusive representation of voter interests.Fourthly, the Electoral College balances the political influence of both large and small states. The apportionment of the Senate often disadvantages large states in terms of political weight. The Electoral College helps to address this issue by giving more attention to large states during the campaign. For example, a close popular vote in Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas a similar victory margin in Wyoming would only yield 3. This balance ensures that the concerns of both large and small states are considered in the presidential election process.Fifthly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This system ensured clear winners in cases like Nixons victory in 1968 and Clintons victory in 1992, where they secured a majority of electoral votes despite a plurality in the popular vote. By providing a decisive outcome, the Electoral College system avoids the complications and costs associated with runoff elections.While critics of the Electoral College argue that it may discourage potential voters if their state leans heavily toward one party, it should be noted that a significant proportion of eligible voters still participate in elections, regardless of the likelihood of their vote affecting the national outcome. Voters express their preferences and contribute to the democratic process, even if their vote is unlikely to sway the final result.In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty of outcome, encourages transregional appeal, focuses candidates attention on swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids runoff elections. These advantages demonstrate why we should maintain the Electoral College to ensure a fair and effective process for choosing the president of the United States.Thank you for considering this perspective. I hope you will take these points into account when discussing any potential changes to our current election system. Alease feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions or would like to discuss this matter in more detail.Sincerely,[Your Name]
