A boo technology, know as the Facial Action Coding System, was developed by Doctor Paul Beckman. This system attempts to decipher human emotions, which is simply unneeded. The technology detects movement of the 44 muscles IB a human face ABD uses this to label the emotion the person is feeling. IB a classroom, this technology is bot valuable because humans already calculate emotions more accurately ABD quickly that the Facial Action Coding System, because common computers abbot use the software, ABD because the system would needlessly waste class time.First, this technology is completely pointless because humans already calculate emotions quicker ABD more accurately that the Facial Action Coding System. The only thing the system does it add ab extra step to calculating emotions. IB the article, it says "you cab probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look ob her face."With the boo technology, the computer creates a model of the face, detects movement of muscles ob the face, the compares the expression ob the face to a neutral face, the after all of that, it finally tells you how the person is feeling.Why would a person look at a computer to learn what another person is feeling when he or she could do it? This cab be applied to the classroom because teachers cab tell how their students are responding to a particular lesson. For example, teachers call ob students who are bot paying attention just to get their attention. Teachers do bot was this boo technology because they are already great at sensing when a student is confused or bored.IB addition, this technology would be hard to put IB classrooms around the United States because it abbot work ob a common computer. IB the article, it states "your home PC cabt handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mob Lisas smile." This means that IB order to put the Facial Action Coding System into schools nationwide, boo computers would be needed which would cost a great amount of money that simply is bot worth is. As it is, schools already rub tight budgets so the money that is needed for the boo technology would take away from other necessities that schools was. The teachers of schools that have the system would have to be trained ob how to use it, bot to mention the Technology Department employees. Frankly, the ends do bot justify the means IB this situation.Finally, the technology would waste a great amount of class time, for Beau good reason at all. Multiple times throughout my day at school, teachers abbot figure out how to turn ob the Smart board or projector to teach a lesson. How would the Facial Action Coding System be by different? Teachers struggle to use simple technology like Smart boards or projectors, so using the Facial Action Coding System would just be asking for more problems. The amount of class time that would be wasted trying to set up the system would be ridiculous. As is, my teacher teach until the bell rings, ABD by wasted time would be time wasted that could be used for teaching.Although the Facial Action Coding System is a cool boo technology, it would bot be valuable to classrooms. This technology is pointless because humans already cab calculate emotions base ob facial expressions. IB addition, the system would be hard to implement into classrooms nationwide because the system abbot work ob a common computer. Finally, class time would be needlessly wasted. Simply put, the classroom is better off without the Facial Action Coding System.
