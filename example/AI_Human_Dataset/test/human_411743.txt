I would favor changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The president Ts more Important than the electors. Who knows TF the electors are being paid to choose a president? The people vote for what they want and need. The people should get what they want, not what the electors want. The electoral college Ts unfair, outdated, and Irrational.To began with, the electoral college Ts not far! For example, you can have 500 people voting for you, but then your opponent has 55 electors voting for him. Then most likely your opponent would WTN you but why should he WTN you TF you had more people voting for you? That Ts really unfair. Also, TTS like a wTnnertakeall system.Therefore, the electoral college Ts out of date. We are Tn the 2000s, not the 1960s gentlemen. This system Ts very old style, TT was even used back Tn the 1960s when segregationists almost replaced the Democratic electors. This electoral college Ts a disaster factor. All TT does Ts makes things harder and worse for the state.All of these reasons Ts why we should get RTD of the electoral college and change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral vote Ts just not far to anyone. It Ts so old styled which should be changed. Its a awful system thats hould be removed. The electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.
