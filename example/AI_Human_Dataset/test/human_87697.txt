As we have two different people, we have two types of parents that one of them, they believe, and they force their children that should take some classes like music, drama, or an art class instead of elective classes. But another parents they do not believe and force them to take those classes. On the other hand we have some students that they like to take elective classes instead of those classes; and in opposite, we have students that they do not like to take elective classes.In general, as we know the place of schools, we can easily discover that students need have some classes that they want to be, and they like to enjoy it and has fun and exciting for them. Here are some reasons that are showed why they have to take those classes; like music, a drama, or an art class. First reason is if they took those classes, they can decrease their stress that they have in their life and their school. Second reason is, they can easily figure out what skills are they have in their life and out of the main classes in school. Third reason is, if they really learned from those classes, they can teach to another persons and get money for that. Fourth reason is, it is good for their health from all aspects. Fifth reason is, it gives them energy; so they can always be active in their life specially in their school.First, on the other hand, some students is special because maybe they came from another country or have special condition that they are not required to take those classes because they have to graduate or because of their English language; so they have to study and practice more; and they can not require taking those classes. They have to take main and elective classes that their counselor suggested to them. For example, I came from another country, so I have to practice more in my English language and other main classes that I have in school, for these reasons I could not take an art, music or a drama class.Second, another students just take those classes because their parents want to, so these students can not learn and enjoy from those classes, and even they will hate from those classes. For example, I saw my friends that he took a music class, but he did not like that, but their parents force and required him to take that class, in summary he fell from all classes that he had in his school, and finally he did not graduate from school because of that.Third, some students that know English language include writing, speaking and listening, and has all As in their main classes like Physics, Math and Chemistry and another main classes, they can take music, an art or a drama class. As I said some benefit of those classes on above, they can improve their skills, and they can go in forward to their life that they want to be.Finally, those classes can be help students a lot, but it has hinge on their status, and no one should not force students to take those classes unless they want to, and they like to take those classes.In conclusion, those classes should not be compulsory, because in general, each work should have been with love, until we can learn and help others and improve ourselves.
