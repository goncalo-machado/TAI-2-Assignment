Usually Students will Start by getting to know each other first. This would be by talking to each other to know who they will be with for the rest of the Season/year. Next, a time goes people will Start creating bond and growing relationship with their peer. Friendship that become really close are always Something Special and Should last forever. Once people Start becoming friend they might choose to hang out and be together. This add to the list of things to do when bored, hanging out with friend. Having and making friend IQ Something important, extracurricularQ will help with that.Second, when participating in extracurricular activities it IQ better than Staying inside all day. Most of the time activities are going to require you to interact with new people. Students can get to See the world and a lot of the time, learn new things.
