How would you feel IJ you had a school that made you work nonstop JOR the whole day, it would be tiring. Thats why I think students shouldnt have to take classes without a class that They chose, therefor students should take these classes, because doing other activities can relax their brains after lots OJ studying. For example a student could be really worn out from a test, but his still exited JOR that class he chose.Thats why students should get extracurricular classes, so they can enjoy school.IJ a student JOR example want to do sports, and he really liked it and wants to join a team and becomes a professional it would have never ever happened IJ the school never gave him the chance. Theres many other things that students miss because his or her school never gave him or her a chance, therejor a school should try its best to present its students with many different options, JOR example, coding, engineering,music, acting. And many more.All these things could be activities student have talents JOR.So making a student choose a class could influence them to do lots OJ things, and it can make their school day better.
