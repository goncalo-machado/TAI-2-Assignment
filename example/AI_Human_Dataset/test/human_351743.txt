Many citizens in the United States rely on cars as a way of transportation. What they dont realize is that there are multiple options to consider instead of a car. "Why consider a new method of transportation?," you may ask. If we limited the car usage we would have great amounts of adamant ages as a result.One important result that would come if we limited car usage is having nearby store locations nearby. " In this new approach stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in a mall along some distant highway."(Source one: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars; paragraph six) Limiting car usage will result in new buildings, stores, houses to become at a fair enough distance to walk.If we had stores nearby enough to walk, theres no need of a car. If car usages reduce, the amount of walking, or riding a bike would increase. This will lead to a better lifestyle. Recent studies have showed that walking daily can improve a persons mind. "When I had car I was always tense, Im much happier this way."(Source one: In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars; paragraph three.)Another major positive affect that will result in reducing car usage is improving our atmosphere. One disadvantage cars cause, is air pollution. One example would be smog. The smog that we breathe in is not good for our health." Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."(Source three;paragraph twenty four). Not only if we reduce car usage we would gain positives outcomes, but we would reduce pollution."Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to fifty percent in some carintensime areas in the United States." (Source one; paragraph time.)  We would be doing positive thing for ourselves but a positive thing for the environment.Our generation does not need to rely on a piece of mechanic to take them to their destination. We have the ability to get to our route, and have other options that are helpful for us and for our environment. We have multiple advantages if we would consider reducing car usage. So the question would be, why dont we stop using cars, and start helping ourselves and our environment knowing the advantages we could be remaining in return.
