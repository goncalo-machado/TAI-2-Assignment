The Electoral College is an important process of voting in the president. Many citizens believe that it should not east and the president should be voted in by popular vote. Its not that simple.Without the Electoral College, the president might not be thoughtfully voted in. The Electoral College Easts for the congress to decide who becomes president and vice president. In the society we live in today, many of the young are voting for who promises stuff that they care about, but not the candidate who is the most qualified and truthful. Congress examines all the information and chooses who would represent the United States the best and who would run the country with an iron first and improve the nation.If Congress didnt use the Electoral College system, the nation could go corrupt. The "popular vote" could be only by a few votes, and the other half of the nation could get extremely angry and rebel in protest. This could possibly start another civil war. By keeping the Electoral College, this would not happen. The country votes, and that counts a little towards the new president. Otherwise, the country is satisfied with the Electoral College system and is used to it by now so wont get upset if who they voted for isnt chosen. Congress, who carefully reviews each candidate, chooses who is the most qualified and votes. Depending on the population of each state, the sectors and representatives get to vote too.The Electoral College system has been part of the United States voting system since the Constitution was signed, and should stay as our main system of voting to keep this country as it originally was and true to its meaning. This is the most effective way of choosing the best candidate for keeping our nation united and strong.
