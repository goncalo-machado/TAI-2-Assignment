What is electoral College? The electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a Compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified Citizens. But it is also a bad thing because you help Choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote for your Kana date you are actually voting for your Kana dates electors. I think electoral Collage is a stupid process and is definitely outdated.In the same light, I think the electoral Collage is a stupid idea because and that they should have got rid of it a long time ago it is like were not even voting anymore its like someone messed up the votes and said that Romney got 538 votes and Obama only got 438 votes. Like bob dole said,"abolish the electoral College".But you have to remember, the electoral College is a good thing to most presidential elections. The only one election that it didnt help on was in 2000 Al Gore revived more individual votes than George Bush nationwide, but bush won the election, relieving 271 electoral votes to gore 266.In Conclusion, electoral Collage is good because it helps presidential elections but its bad because it is like the U.S. riding the votes
