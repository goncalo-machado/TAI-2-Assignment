Dear PrincipalPlease do not change the school policy, many students Have a C average. It wont be fair to the students that Have a C average. If their isnt enough players that Have a B average they wont be able to play the other team.Not many students will be able to play if they Have a C average. Many students will be disappointed if they cant play. Also, many of the good players Have a C average and if they cant play the team would probably lose. Many parents would be disappointed too if they see that their children is not playing. The parents might come and protest because you wont let their children play if they dont Have a B average. Their probably wont be anything good on the school paper if most of the students cant play. Most student love to play sports after school because it gives them time to not think about school. This is way you shouldnt change the school policy.
