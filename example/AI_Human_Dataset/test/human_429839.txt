Do Lou think it is more beneficial for student to attend school from home through an online course or attend physical school. Online school provides a variety of benefits that regular school cant compare to and there is many reasons for but mainly it is because of the stress school holdsStudents can get the same education the need from school without all the rules and directions that apply when in school in an online course on a computer. Some students do not enjoy the feeling of being around a lot of people get flustered which can hinder students learning and decrease their overall performance in school an online school program, which Lou can attend from the comfort of lour home where Lou feel calm, could greatly benefit these types of students with the problems the have and would completely erase these obstacles.If the world changed the education system to mainly online school, parents would be relived of the stress of finding transportation to and from their school the so choose and also waking up these children at very early times in the morning.Online students will be at home rather than at a building for 6 hours and be able to feel free and not constrained for example if a student needs a brake from there work the could simply go for a walk or get snack, but this is not possible for physical schools, leaving the property of school holds severe consequences and most of the time the only brakes Lou can get in school are either to get water, bathroom and the cafeteria which is not a health option of food.Some people MAL argue that physical school provides a real world experience with being around people, having teamwork and following rules. Despite these reasons students can still this experience. The people Lou live with Lou have to work together with and follow lour parents rules for the house and Lou still have to follow overall life rules so without physical school Lou can still get the same experience.In conclusion the benefits from an online school are far greater than a physical one. If online schools were the main option for education the world would benefit greatly.
