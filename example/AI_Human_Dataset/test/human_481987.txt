Street parking and garages have been forbidden fog a while. Only way you would have a garage was if you purchased one with you home. Thege were only two places you could park at and thats really only fog two cars.Paris banned people from giving there cars, up to 4,000 people were fined, so most of everybody CAG was impounded. To me there losing money because the amount of people that buy gas fog there cars if you think about it thats a big lost how many people in Paris give cars themes going to be a big percentage of the money gone due to this CAG ending madness. Some delivery places couldnt even have cars so its messing up that money too.CAG Free Day I find strange because no one can give. its too many people in the would everyone if not going to fit on the busses they have, due to this tragic people have to now walk where they have to go. If you dont have a bike OG skateboard then you gout of luck so since this happened no one really got where they needed to be. I think even people had to miss work fog this, also the kids. How would they get to school ? To me banning cars would be the dumbest idea anyone even made up. This would would come to an end without cars.In America people in giving population goes up by the hour, like when you travel you go more miles than you think you do. Most people in America have stopped giving and stage traveling by bus. With all these changes, people who stopped CAG commuting as a result they may find less season to resume the habit.
