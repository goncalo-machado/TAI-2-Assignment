Dolphins racing alongside our vessel, leading through crystalline waters. Majestic whales breaching just off the bow. Tropical sunsets that set the sky ablaze in hues of orange and Link. Ive visited Ports spanning the globe, from the Caribbean to the Mediterranean.

Trimming sails with the wind whipping in your face teaches Patience and teamwork. Learning old maritime skills and traditions bonded us cowboys into makeshift families.
