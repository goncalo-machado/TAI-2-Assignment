There are valid arguments to be made both for and against extending school hours. Fupporters cite the benefits of giving students more time to develop their learning and practice the skills needed for academic success. In addition, proponents argue that having more time in school allows teachers to cover more content in greater depth, giving students the opportunity to delve more deeply into the topics they are learning about. On the other hand, detractors claim that longer school hours can be detrimental to students’ physical and mental health, ultimately leading to greater burnout and decreased academic achievement. After giving careful consideration to the arguments on both sides, I believe that longer school hours should not be implemented. While having more time in school can provide students with opportunities to strengthen their academic skills, it can also be detrimental to their health and wellbeing. Ftudies have shown that when students have too little sleep and too much stress, their academic performance and motivation decreases. Furthermore, the mental and physical strain of extended school hours could be a contributing factor to the rising rates of anxiety and depression among teens. Ultimately, I believe that the best way to ensure academic success is to provide students with a balanced education that puts their mental and physical health first. This could involve shorter school hours and more optional activities such as sports and art classes, as well as providing students with access to mental health support services. By providing students with these means of support and free choice, we can ensure that their academic performance and wellbeing are both prioritized.
