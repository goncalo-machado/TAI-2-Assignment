Dear principle,I understand that come people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it IC very important to at least try to change it. Requiring students to do community service will make keep our community a clean and café environment. Therefore, I believe that community service could be required for students at school not every day, but at least maybe twice a week.By doing this, you and everyone else who participate in this could be rewarded, but at the came time take responsibility to keep on making this place better for everybody. Some students may help with tutoring other students who need help with schoolwork or something along the line of that. Other people go around picking track up of the ground and putting it where it belong and trying their best to keep our environment clean.Today, we still have people going around throwing track on the ground. I myself, have experienced people putting track on the ground and leaving it there. It hurt me because everyday I look at how much work people put into making schools, office building, restaurant, etc. I hope that you have learned a lot from this and go along with requiring students to do community service no matter what it IC they are doing.Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
