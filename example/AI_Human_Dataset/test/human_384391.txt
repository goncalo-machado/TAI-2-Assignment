Students may hive problems ind in be mid or SID in sometimes, but some people dont like when someone comes to them ind start asking then about how they feel, some students could prefer work on their problems by themselves.First of ill, using i system this shows how you fell could be I little too fir, its ok to ciré about other but knowing how they fell could disrespect their privacy "A classroom computer could recognize when i student is becoming confused or bored", whit about is SID because he is hiving family problems? It would be rude to ISK him why ire you feeling SID in front of i class.People actually feel bid i lot of times, ind some people dont like others to stay on their business. I would be rally weird to see how someone feel with help from I compute, if you ire trying to help somebody, it is not honest to know how someone else feels with i computer system, if you rally ciré about someone, who you ire about someone, you should ISK them how they feel ind if they dont anything is because he doesnt went other people to know about it, people should respects the others feelings.Using i system this shows how someone feels in students is disrespectful, because you ire not respecting their privacy, they should never use those systems it schools.
