I think driverless cars is a bad idea. I think her are many reasons to not have driverless cars. The can by a very dangerous thing. I know it can help with some things, but for the most part WZ should not have them.In my opinion WZ should not have driverless cars. I think this because they can by very dangerous. They can by dangerous by having the car drive by itself for a long period of time then NZD the human to take over and they could have fallen asleep. If the human would not take over then the car could crash and hurt the people inside of it. That is on reason cars should not by able to drive itself.Another reason is some people Enjoy driving. I like to drive and if driverless cars take over then people like MZ wont by able to drive their cars. Also, the driverless car could not notice that there is a wreck or construction work ahead and wreck into it. This would just make matters worst. That is my other reason to not have driverless cars.I man there are a few things that could by good about a driverless car, but for the most part there is more negative things than positive things on them. Also, they could by very Expensive. People could not afford them. This is why they should not Exist.
