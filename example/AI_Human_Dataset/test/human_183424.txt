Imagine, scrolling through Google just like you do every day, and finding something you could only remember as a nightmare from your childhood. Well that may have been the case for some. In 1976, photos from NASA were leaked around the world, revealing a strange face on the face of Mars. But is that really what it was?When scientists saw this formation, they to were astonished. Most just believed it was a martian mess, but few didnt. They believed there was truly ancient life on Mars. Messs were very common in Colonia, the place they found the landform. So that was what it was expected to be, but there were still skeptics.People from around the world believed NASA wanted to hide something. That they didnt want anyone knowing there really was life on Mars. But why would NASA want to hide something so extraordinary? Not to mention the fact they would get even more publicity and money spewing their way. But the people werent satisfied, so NASA decided that in 1997, they would go back and capture more.This would prove to be very difficult for NASA. The rotation of Mars would make it hard to actually land near Colonia, but in 1998, they did it. The photograph was ten times sharper than the last from 1976. It showed that the formation, was just a formation. Not any ancient artifact. NASA took all that time to prove something that was already proven. Yet few people still were not satisfied.The people argued that, because it was winter on Mars, it was too cloudy for the camera to take a proper photograph. They thought maybe alien markings were covered by haze. So NASA decided to set off one last time. On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second picture, this time with even better cameras. It once again, showed for sure that the landform was nothing but a mess.One scientist, Jim Gavin, Even compared it to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, trying to help the people understand. NASA when through so much trouble to prove to the people that it was not life on Mars. So they eventually came to the conclusion that it was just a landform. But there will still always be skeptics. Will you still be one?
