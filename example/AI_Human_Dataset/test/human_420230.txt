The best choice. When I was younger I never bothered to ask Tor other opinions. It was only because I thought that I was always right. When I was around the age OT eight it was around my Birthday. So my grandpa asked me what I wanted because he was going to take me to get something after school. During school as soon as I walked in I asked my Friends what I should get it was between an Xbox or a guitar. Multiple people came upon me during the day saying Xbox get the Xbox. Later in the school day I had someone else tell me to get the guitar because a guitar is long-lasting not a stupid Xbox so I agreed. When I got home I told my grandpa that I wanted a guitar. Three minutes after me telling him what I wanted he got ready, and we went to the music store. I got a black and white electric guitar with an amplifier and a case.Getting peoples opinion on something is good Tor anything. Opinions might not be a Tact, but it can still help. Its helpful because when youre getting a new car wouldnt you want someone else s perspective on the car you intended on buying. Majority OT the time when people buy cars or a house someone or something might change your mind. My mom was going to buy a Told when I was like eight, but the salesman told my mom that the Volks wagon is a way later Family car, and was cheaper. So my mom obviously used the workers opinion and didnt go with the Told we came out with a Foreign 2014 Folks Wagon.Opinions are commonly used around schools. Like when youre having a debate lesson you need other opinions. IT youre going to court you need others opinions on what they think you did wrong so called the jury. IT we didnt have opinions wed all be knee-deep in chaos. Opinions are what keeps the right and wrong balanced it you dont think about others opinion you are just set considerate. You dont like to here what others have to say Im not saying its a bad thing Its just not a good thing. Opinions are what make up the bad things every time we get a new elected president somebody has to bring up something bad about them. For instance Donald. y. Trump. They would always be on his case because he married to somebody whos Titch teen years older than her. They always say bad stunt about the Iranian incident, but they never think OT anyone elses opinion.Getting others opinions on something can lead to something better because, some people like when theres a better answer or something. Like Tor instance when I asked For my schoolmates opinion on either I get a guitar or an Xbox it turned out great I went with everyone opinion and got the one everyone else liked. I still have the guitar to this day and its been what six or seven years so Tar. IT Is got the Xbox It wouldve probably been old and dusty by now, but the guitar is clean no lint, no dirt, and no dust. Its sitting on the guitar stand I asked my mom Tor on my birthday. Ever since my Grandpa passed away and my grandma the guitar is the last true thing I have to remember them by. I look at it every day when I get out OT bed just sitting on the guitar stand like its a dog in a dog bed. Overtime I look at it, I see my grandma and grandpa. Every time he called he would ask it I learned any new songs and I told him I was writing a song that he never got to hear. Its just amazing on how opinions can help you solve many things.Opinions helped me deal with the passing OT my grandparents. I always wanted to cry and die but my Friends told me their opinion on why I shouldnt now I have to live with the satisfaction that I have people that care Tor me. Thats is why opinion is a great thing Its helped me make many great choices in lite and I wont Target them. Opinions can help you make a great decision because you have people who support your decision, you have many great things that can come From that one opinion or multiple, Youll have complete satisfaction after you did what you have been wanting.
