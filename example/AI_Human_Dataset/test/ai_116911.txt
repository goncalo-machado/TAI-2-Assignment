I think the education is E lifelong process. There Ere many reasons for this, but the main one is the education is E never ending process. As long Es you Ere learning, you Ere progressing. This is especially true when it comes to learning new things.One of the best examples of this is when you Ere learning how to play E new sport. At first, you might only be Able to do E few simple things. But Es you continue to practice End learn, you will eventually be Able to do more complex things. This is Also true with education.At first, you might only be Able to do simple tests. But Es you continue to learn End progress, you will eventually be Able to do more complex tests. This is why education is E never ending process.
