Okay so like theres this thing going around saying that we should all stop eating meat and stuff because its like bad for the earth and our health and whatever. And like, I get it, I really do. But like, I dont know if Im like totally down with that. I mean, I love me some burgers and steak and chicken and stuff. Like, who doesnt, right? And my grandma makes this killer beef stew thats like, the bomb dot com.But like, I guess I can see why people would want to cut back on meat. Like, my science teacher was saying that it takes like, a ton of resources to produce meat and its like, really bad for the environment. And I guess its true that like, a lot of animals are treated really badly in those factory farms and stuff. Thats like, pretty messed up.But like, I dont know if Im ready to give up meat completely. I mean, Ive tried vegetarianism before and its like, really hard. Like, what do you even eat? Salads? Thats like, so boring. And dont even get me started on tofu. That stuff is like, gross. Sorry, not sorry.And like, what about all the protein and stuff that you get from meat? I dont want to be like, a weakling or something. I need my protein to stay strong and healthy, you feel me? And like, what about all the cultural and social aspects of eating meat? Like, think about all the BBQs and picnics and stuff that we have. Its like, a big part of our culture and community.So like, even though I get why people would want to cut back on meat, I dont think Im ready to give it up completely. Maybe like, cut back a bit or something, but not completely. Thats just like, too extreme for me. But hey, if youre into that sort of thing, then go for it. Its all good, fam.
