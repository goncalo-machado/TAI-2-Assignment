Ok, So some people believe that the "Unmasking The Face On Mars" was created by aliens. Crazy right!Well the Face On Mars is just a natural landform. To back my opinion about this it states in the passage that," A spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landings cities for its sister ship Viking 2, when spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face." so technical thats how the face of the Mars got there but, thats not it. "Scientist figured it was another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia." Then the huge rock formation it resembled a human head which was formed be the shadows that were giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This would be a good way to engage the public and attraction to Mars the authors had thought. Then it began to Starr in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and etc. But NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. But in the meantime defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. But to be direct the face on Mars was located at 41 degree north martian latitude where it was winter in April. Well there is much more to this, but this is some reasons and facts about how the face on Mars was a natural landform.
