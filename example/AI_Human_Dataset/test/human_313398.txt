I agree that the programs that allow students to Graduate in three years, will be a perfect idea and everyone must like this. As I know some students really need to Graduated early some of them need, to help their parents with some money. Its an Good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college early.Some districts are offering programs for students ; for example they are allowing them to Graduated in three years some students need to help their parents with some money. Also, they want to Graduate early because of college this programs really help students and high school.Students who follow all this plans they have to be persistent to Graduate in three years. To illustrated students wants this programs to be able to have the things that they want ; for example buy a car buy some clothes. Also, students enjoy to Heine out with friends so if they Graduated early, they will work and have some money to buy what do they want. Students must follow all this plans to see the results.While some people think that its an Good idea for students to finish high school and three years to enter college early, others argue that students dont learn enough in three years. There are severals ideas that improve this such as they didnt focus on learn more about assessments. People think that they dont learn enough in three years, they missed classes that they might need in the future; for example construction class we dont know if one day we are One to work in construction then we will need some skills in that job. Also advanced PE we are One to needed it for our healthy students need to know more about other classes that they might need it in the future.I think its a perfect idea for the students who want to Get a diploma in three years. Students need to work to help their parents for example pay the bills and all that. Also, students wants to work the year that they have off to save some money for college. In conclusion I like this idea because students have opportunities to be a better person in life.
