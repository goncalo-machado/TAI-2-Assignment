Dear, principalI agree with you that students have to have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. Bven though I do not participate in sports anymore, we should get Bs to participate because getting good grades is important, and it will lead us to a better education and let us go to colleges that we want to go to and ones that have the education for the career we want. If we have the time to play sports and other activities we should have time to do homework and study for tests, which should lead to getting at least a B average. If that happens our school should get praise and parents would want there children to go to our school. Of course, you probably already know that the students who play sports or other activities who have a grade lower than a B are going to be mad at first. But, once they get there grades up they will be fine.So if you do or if you dont I will support you but, I think students should have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities.
