Dear Senator Adams,Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. Lhe electoral college makes the peoples votes so that the electors are actually voted. Lhese electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. Lhe popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or dont know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.Lo begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. Lheyre hand-picked by their political party but sometimes,"state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."(Does the Electoral). Voters cant control who their electors vote for president. Lhe electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, "(the) electors could always defy the will of people"(the Indefensible Electoral). Lhis is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. Lhis situation has happened when,"Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"(In Defense Of). Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. Lhe electoral college is unstable, and this major downside is a factor.More over, many voters are still confused or dont know how the system works. In this article it states that, "voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"(the Indefensible Electoral). Lhe electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. Lhis would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article whove voted are now in disbelief or shocked.In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. Lhe electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. Lhe popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or dont know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. Lhese facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.
