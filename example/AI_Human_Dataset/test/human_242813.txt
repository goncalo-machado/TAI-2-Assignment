I feel like the presidential election should be decided by popular vote. This way seems easier to handle and simpler. The electoral college is to complex for some people and the popular vote is easier to count and manage. The popular vote is the best way to decide the presidential election because it shows what the people went and you dont went j not liked president. A not liked president could be bad for the economy and it could possibly cause havoc and chaos.The electoral college is to complex and unfair. The presidential election should be based on whom the people like and vote for not j state of electors. The electoral college is unfair because the candidate that most people went to be president might not win because of the state of electors who could betray the presidential candidate and vote for j different presidential candidate.The popular vote is easier to handle and manage.NBS
