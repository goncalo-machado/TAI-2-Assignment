Near Senator,I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people, and that all citizens votes are equal.The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer serves the needs of our country. It was created in the 18th century, when the United States was a very different place. At that time, there were only 13 states, and communication and travel were much more difficult than they are today. The Electoral College was designed to give small states a voice in the presidential election, but it is no longer necessary.In todays society, all citizens have an equal right to vote. We should not allow the Electoral College to disenfranchise millions of people. In the 2000 election, Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the election because he lost the Electoral College. This is simply not fair.There are many arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. One argument is that it is undemocratic. The Electoral College allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. When this happens, it means that the majority of the people are not represented in the White House.Another argument in favor of abolishing the Electoral College is that it gives too much power to a few small states. The Electoral College gives each state a number of electors equal to the number of seats it has in Congress. This means that small states have more power than they would have if the President were elected by popular vote.Finally, the Electoral College is simply not necessary. In the 21st century, we have the ability to communicate and travel easily across the country. There is no reason why we need to keep a system in place that gives more power to some states than others.I urge you to support a bill that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This is the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people, and that all citizens votes are equal.Thank you for your time.Sincerely,[Your Name]
