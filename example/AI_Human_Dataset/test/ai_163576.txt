I think schools shunt have meditation and mindfulness. Its a waste of time. We should be learning not sitting around doing nothing. If no supposed to help us relax and focus but I dont think its working. I mean, how many times have you sat in class and your mind starts to wander? You start thinking about your weekend plans or that cute boy in your class and BAM! You just lost 10 minutes of learning.And what about the kids who cant sit still? Theyll just get in trouble for fidgeting, and itll be a distraction for everyone else. My friend has ADHD, and she cant sit still for more than 5 minutes without getting up and walking around. Shed get in so much trouble if they made her do meditation.Plus, its not fair to the kids who dont want to do it. If no some people who are atheists and they dont want to do something thats "spiritual" or "religious". They shunt be forced to do something that goes against their beliefs.And what about the teachers? They have enough to do already without having to learn how to teach meditation. Theyre already overworked and underpaid. We should be focusing on giving them more resources and support instead of adding more things to their plate.In conclusion, meditation and mindfulness shunt be included in schools. Its a waste of time, unfair to some students, and a distraction. We should be focusing on giving teachers more support and resources, so they can do their job to the best of their ability.
