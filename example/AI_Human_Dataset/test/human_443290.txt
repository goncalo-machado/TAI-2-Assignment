Dear principal,I think we should be part of the community service because that was the student can learn not to litter. It will also make the schools much cleaner and a cleaner school means a cleaner community. It will also teach the students some good deeds. For example, cleaning is part of responsibility and caring for tour community. If we take the other side we are just going to end up messing the schools and the community. Im pretty sure we do not want that now. We all want a healthier more clean looking neighborhood or even community. But it first starts here in school. Yes, we are going to take time away from them, but what do teenagers do when on their spare time? The teat and litter. Thats WHT if we start community service we would keep the streets, schools, and the community cleaner. We would also keep the teenagers from doing what the do best which is littering. Littering is bad for both to and the community. It makes are community look dirt, but not only that, it also makes are plants, crops, and are grass from growing health. We could have been getting rich soil good crops, plants, grass, and furthermore. But instead were getting the opposite which is pollution. Thats all I got to respond. So now its on to principals is either cleaner society or just the was it is pure pollution.
