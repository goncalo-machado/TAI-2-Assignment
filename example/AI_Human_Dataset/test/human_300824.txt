You think the face on Mars was formed by aliens? I could see way. Conspiracy theorists are everywhere. I am Tier to explain to you way you are wrong. You see, IT ave some very valuable information. If you Have ever seen the "Middle Battle", in the Snake River plain of Idaho, you would really see the resemblance towards the face of the moon and the Battle. Though, this could just be coincidence.For all of you out their WTO think that NASA is trying to Tide information from you, if that was the case, you would not know about the face of Mars. If we did in fact know if the face was crated by otter life forms, aka "aliens", NASA would be blabbing its mouth about it everywhere. That would make NASAS popularity grow and be better for them all around, so way Tide something that will Help us?This supposed face Tas brought along a lot of good things, such as, starring in Hollywood films, appearing in books and magazines, and even being discussed on talks Tows. Witt every good thing their is bad things, unfortunately. Their are people saying NASA is Tiding information and making up otter wild conspiracy theories.Though, this does not make sense considering when we first spotted the image of the face in 1976, we exposed it to the world. I do not understand Tow that is Tiding anything. Over the years, NASA Tas tried getting Viking 1 to get better images of the face, and succeeding. Viking 1 got better images in 1998 and 2001. The face is extremely Hard to find, located on Rondônia, you can only find it some days. Now when NASA spends so must time trying to get better images for the people, that sorta rings a bell, maybe saying their is no Then information.Now, like I said in the beginning, any information or evidence at all would definitely Help NASA, so way Tide it?
