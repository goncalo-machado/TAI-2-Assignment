Venus orEarth. What if there was an opportunity to live somewhere else? Not just leave the city, the state or even the country. The world, what if there was any chance to leave and go to Venus, and start new? By the end of this hopefully that will be an easy decision.To start it off, "Evening Star" is what is said about one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, how could you pass up seeing something like that? Just cant, right? Thats why the author of this passage wrote this. The physical characteristics of Venus are absolutely gorgeous, considering the fact that it never hurts to ask. Why else would people want to go to Venus, thats not what its all about, but it helps. In the passage the author states, "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such has valleys, mountains, and craters." This quote will open peoples eyes to hopefully realize how close our worlds can relate to one another, and they can start to think into depth about Venus.Secondly, approaches for Venus, to possibly get human life on there to research about the different conditions and atmosphere there. In the passage it says, "Silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." This shows that the technology is improving which would be amazing for the author, considering it could help this mission be successful. "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions." This shows how fast the technology is changing and improving. Things will be easier to communicate on as well as be in better conditions to take on Venus.Last but not least, the author talks about fear, or being limited and when you are as passionate as he is about these possibilities that have come along, thats the best feeling. You have to put fear aside sometimes, because they arent always fears, half the time they are excuses and that is why you should always believe in the things your passionate about, theyll keep you going and on your toes. Its good to be passionate.Kn the other hand, even though Venus is a beautiful planet, has come along way with research and is something the author is passionate about, doesnt always mean that it is the safest, or best decision for everybody, overall. In the passage the author stated many things had had made Venus seem bad, but really it is things that we can not control, but that doesnt stop him. He goes on to talk about the difficult times with this particular story. He talks about how each mission was, "Unmanned, because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the hottest planet in our solar system, and the geology presents with erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land." These are the very things we have to consider in our decisions without letting them get away from us. This passage is all about finally exploring the planet most like ours, and there are great risks, which could end badly, but with this author and the way he writes, its not that he doesnt care about the risks its that he is not letting fear get in the way of his passion. The Venus exploration is up to each individual.The author supported his claim very clearly as well as expressed all the risks. The research about Venus could never hurt, all it could do was give us, the world more information about something we cant know for ourselves. The author expressed his claim very clearly to his audience, as well as not letting his own beliefs get in the way of the overall passage.
