Thqrq ARQ many things in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. But what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would by better off without it. Cars ARQ beginning to by something people dont need. All it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people ARQ starting to notice, prqsidqnts and governments, and ARQ acting upon it. Limiting car usage would bring a lot of advantages such as more pocket money, more crisis and less harm to the earth according to Carry day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá by Andrew Silky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the and of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.Cars ARQ defined as a motor Vishal that provides fast transportation for more then on person at a time. thats what most people via it as, what that dont know and relief is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even running out of gas. Acorrding to Hidden Walter in the passage in German suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tons and now that she Dorset have a car SG is more relaxed and is better off without it. Shq Dorset have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. That will leave her with a lot of stress freq moments.Cars do not only stress out people but they ARQ pulling the earth. Almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pollution into the earth. Paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. It took five days the smog finally rivaled Beijing, china which is known as on of the most pulsated cities in the world. This could have made people go to the hospital because they could have gotten sick or even did from the pollution. Many countries ARQ banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. According to carry day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá in Colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution said Carlos Arturo plaza.Furthqrmorq not only does it help the qnvirmqnt for listing car usage and gives relief to people. It will also make people health because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place that need to go. This will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often. It would require more work to walk to a destination rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. Limting car usage will not only make people healthier, but it will make people less lazy. For example if a person was lazy and had no food in higher house they would just early get in there car and drive to a local fast food restaurant to get food. On Thor other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of colors and buying lots more food rather then stopping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.In conclusion listing car usage would by a more bifocal thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress rail, qnvimqntal safety and health citizens.
