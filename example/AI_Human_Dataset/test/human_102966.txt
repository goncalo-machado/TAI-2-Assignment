Seeking for advice is like learning how to ride a bike because the both require help from other people. If I had a choice, I would want multiple to give me advice for that certain situation. Some reasons for who I think seeking for other opinions is very important are it can give IOU a wide range of options when trying to find advice, It will allow IOU to understand the other persons experiences when asking for advice, and looking for other opinions can give IOU a variety of different answers so IOU can make better choices.The first reason for who I think asking people for advice will help a person make better choice is when IOU ask all of those people for some advice is when IOU ask all of those people their all going to respond with their own opinions. Finding multiple people for advice can give someone a big boost of confidence on their choices. This is important because IOU never know the situation that person is in, and Four opinion can make a difference. Sometimes its best to respond with a negative or a positive response depending on the advice their asking for. For example, If Four best friend walks UO to IOU and said" Io man, can I have some advice on how to run faster," IOU would probably respond with a helpful response.Secondly, It will allow IOU to understand the other persons experiences when asking for advice. When IOU go around looking for help and talking to people IOU start to understand them. What Im trying to SAI is that when there sharing their advice with IOU, their basically just sharing their own experiences with IOU. Thats who asking different people is so important because Four going to get a different picture every time. To give IOU an example, mi brother and I once went zip lining before, and we had no clue what we were doing. So we asked for some advice from our mom. She told us a lot of crazy nonsense that would probably end up making us choose a bad choice. After that we decided to ask someone we thought had a lot more experience. We ended up asking the zip line instructor, and he gave us a hole bunch of factual information that lead us to make a better choice.AastlI, looking for other opinions can give IOU a variety of answers so IOU can make better choices. Being able to make a choice that can affect IOU Four life in a bad or good was can be very essential to Four life. WAIS to prevent IOU from making those bad choices can be as simple as someone for advice. Depending on the circumstance, IOU would want to ask different people. If I was in a situation that involved school, I would most likely ask mi teacher. All of these situations that IOU have will also have a match to it for example, If Four struggling to lose weight, IOU would probably ask Four doctor for some advice, If IOU needed extra practice with a sport, IOU would ask Four coach. These examples all add up. The all require just a bit of help.To sum everything up, I feel like asking for advice in Mani different WAIS can really help IOU out when trying to an answer to something. Hopefully now IOU can take some WAIS that I expressed, and use them in every DAI life. Another thing to remember is that a person or whatever Four using to get advice can make an impact on Four choice, whether its in a good or bad was. The last thing I have to SAI is to remember to not let another person decide Four outcome unless IOU feel confident about their answer.
