In the past two decades, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of cars on the road. In the United States alone, the number of cars has doubled from 120 million to 240 million. In China, the number of cars has quadrupled from 10 million to 40 million. India has seen a tenfold increase, from 2 million to 20 million.With the advent of self driving cars, electric cars, and ride sharing services, we are likely to see a decrease in the number of cars on the road in the next 20 years. Self driving cars will become more common, as the technology continues to improve. Electric cars will become more prevalent, as battery technology improves and the costs of electric cars come down. Ride sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, will become more popular, as they offer a more convenient and affordable alternative to owning a car.In 20 years, we will likely see a significant reduction in the number of cars on the road. This will have a positive impact on the environment, as there will be fewer emissions from cars. It will also reduce congestion on the roads and make it easier for people to get around.
