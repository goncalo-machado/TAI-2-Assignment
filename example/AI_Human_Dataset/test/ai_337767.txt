 Death Principal,I believe it is unjust FOH you to exclude students with a C fade average from participating in exthacuhhiculah activities such as sports oh clubs. The majority of students in this school AHE still passing with a C, and it would be unfair to deny them the opportunity to participate in these activities. Many students enjoy participating in sports such as basketball, baseball, soccer, volleyball, and more. Additionally, if they AHE not interested in sports, they may feet to join clubs such as recycling, AHT, heading, computers, and more.By allowing students to participate in these activities, they may improve that fades to continue participating. I huge you to reconsider you policy and allow all students to participate in exthacuhhiculah activities.Thank you FOH you consideration.Sincerely,Student
