Summer Vacation vs. Short Breaks: Which is Better for Students?As an 8th grader, I have often wondered whether long summer vacations or short breaks throughout the school year are more beneficial for students. After conducting research and analyzing the effects of both, I have come to the conclusion that long summer vacations are more advantageous for student retention and motivation.CN the one hand, short breaks throughout the school year can provide students with a much needed respite from the rigors of academic life. These breaks can help students recharge their batteries, reduce stress, and improve their overall wellbeing. For example, a study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that students who take short breaks throughout the school year tend to have higher levels of motivation and engagement in their studies (ACES, 2020).However, I believe that long summer vacations offer more benefits for students. During these extended breaks, students have the opportunity to explore their interests and hobbies outside the classroom. They can travel, volunteer, or participate in sports and other extracurricular activities that help them develop new skills and build their confidence. A study by the University of California, Berkeley found that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have higher levels of academic achievement and are more likely to attend college (UCB, 2019).Moreover, long summer vacations allow students to disconnect from the constant pressure of academic expectations and social media. In todays fast paced digital age, it is easy for students to feel overwhelmed by the demands of school and social media. Taking a long break from these pressures can help students recharge and refocus their energy on their academic and personal goals.While some argue that long summer vacations can lead to a "summer slide" in academic performance, I believe that this effect can be mitigated with proper planning and engagement. Parents and educators can help students stay engaged in learning during the summer by providing them with educational resources and activities, such as reading books, participating in online courses, or attending summer camps and workshops.In conclusion, while short breaks throughout the school year can provide students with some benefits, I believe
