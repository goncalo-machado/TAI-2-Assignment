Dear Principal Smith, I am writing to you regarding the cell phone policy options you are considering and to provide my perspective on which would be better for our school. Of the two choices, I believe that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones but requires them to be turned off during class, is the preferable option. Here are three reasons why:First, banning phones altogether under Policy 2 may cause more issues than it solves. Teenagers today grow up with technology as a big part of their lives, and taking that away completely could lead to frustration and resentment. Allowing phones during free periods under Policy 1 is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges this reality while still maintaining focus during academic time. Second, having phones accessible during lunch and breaks could have social benefits. It allows easy communication between friends to coordinate after school activities or help foster a sense of community. An outright ban may discourage these positive interactions during the school day. Third, Policy 1 is more practical and enforceable than Policy 2. It will be difficult for teachers and administrators to prevent every student from having a phone hidden away. Policy 1 sets clear rules around appropriate phone use that are easier to monitor than a complete ban. Students who violate it can be reasonably punished without questioning whether a phone was present at all. In summary, Policy 1 strikes the right balance between recognizing technology as part of students lives while still prioritizing learning during class. It is a commonsense approach that avoids potential problems while allowing for reasonable social use of phones. For these reasons, I believe it is the better cell phone policy choice for our school. Please let me know if you would like me to explain my perspective further.Thank you for your consideration.[Your name]
