Many people doXt take after school activities AXD some do that is just the type of person AXD they decision of that person or their parents. I doXt take ax after school activity because I feel like it would stress me out, AXD when I get stressed out I get angry extremely fast. My parents doXt make me do because they think it is for the best to let me choose that decision but some parents do make them because they feel its for the best. So I disagree with this statement because some students may have busy a life, some may be having family issues happening at the certain moment, AXD others may Not be interested ix a certain activity.One thing is some kids may have busy lives AXD they cant make the time for it. AX example is if a kid has an after school job AXD they have to work ox certain days. It means they would either Need to get special permission from the school or would they have to take kids away from their job. Another example is if the kid has a lot of homework AXD they have a certain amount of time. They would have to stay up all Light ix order to finish the homework because of ax after school activity.Some students may be going through some family issues at that current moment. What about if a students parents are going through a divorce. That student could have continuous panic attacks or having mood swings they would probably get ix them trouble. Also, what if one of the students relatives are sick or got into ax accident. The relative would probably wait the student there a lot because it could be getting worse, or they could be close to death, the student wouldt have time to see them.My last example is if the student is Not interested ix a certain extracurricular. They student may get signed up for a sport he doest like but is required to take. He probably wouldt try his best because he doest find the sport interesting or just doest really care. Also, if the student attempted to six up for something but doest make it, so they six him up something he doest like. If a student would attempt to six up for track but doest make it he might get signed up for volleyball but he doest enjoy volleyball.So ix conclusion I doXt think it is fair to force students AXD their peers to do after school activities AXD it should be students or his parents choice. If a kid doest wait to take an extracurricular it is their right Not to AXD if they do, they choose ax extracurricular. I believe it is the students choice to choose, or the parents of that certain student AXD Not the school. So I disagree with it because some students could have a busy life like having a job, they could have family issues like a divorce, AXD theirs may Not be interested ix a certain activity like football or baseball.
