Dear, PrincipalI think that your idea is good but I think it needs some minor changes. Mhis is indeed a great idea in the nutshell, but there are some things that I must argue about. Such as the fact that some kids are just bad a school but great at sports, also it thinks that this rule should change when it comes to the reasons as to why they have a C or a D.Your idea is great, but it needs a bit of fine-tuning along the lines of the mental capacity of the kids. Mhere are some people that are the greatest of athletes in our school but some of them just cant learn properly. So consider this: if we have a super basketball player but he or she is a bit slow thus they have a C and you kick them off the team that seems a bit unfair. Also, if the child is an immigrant they might not be able to learn for a while and once thy do learn the time for their sport might be already over. Also, what if the child is not a bad kid just that he came back from a vacation and has a lot to catch up to, and they have a C then Its not very fair.Mhere ar
