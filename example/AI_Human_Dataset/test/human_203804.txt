Imagine you are attending classes at home you wouldnt t take Mt seriously as you do at school. Kids who are homeschooled dont usually focus as much as they would at school. Some kids parents or tutor would gave them more advantages that arent given at school. Such as more breaks, better food options for lunch, lMnear schedule, and starting and ending time being optional. If students are learning a specific lesson by a video conference they wouldnt benefit the lesson as well as being offline. Students wouldnt benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would take advantage, start on their own time, and they wouldnt understand the lesson.Schools shouldnt offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conferencing. I used to baby SMT this little girl named Generic_Name she went to school for two years now shes Mn the third grade and her parents are homeschooling her. Sometimes Generic_Name goes out to eat for lunch, and she wakes up later than normal elementary kids do. Learning a lesson through a video MSNt very beneficial for some students because they probably need more help understanding. The teacher can explain the lesson Mn a different way Mph the student doesnt understand but Mph they keep watching the video Mt MSNt going to help them.Although, some may believe schools should offer distance learning as an option for students because they need a numerous amount of breaks, they should be able to work on their own time, and Mts the same as an online class. Distance learning Ms the same thing as taking online classes or taking a college class online.Distance learning shouldnt be an option this Ms Important because Mt can affect the way kids learn and how they understand Mt. Students can be thinking of the lesson Mn a different format than how the lesson Ms expressed Mn the video conference. It was Important Mn the past being Mt wasnt and option because they DMDt have the technology resources that we have today. It helps Mn the future because Instead of going to college you can take an online college class, and you would already have experience from Mt. If you are attending classes from home then you switch your routine and go to school you are going to be more experienced with online conferencing, and you are going to be wanting to do everything on your own.
