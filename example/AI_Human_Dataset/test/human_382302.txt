Some schools require students TK complete summer projects TK continue their learning Over the summer. The question is should the students projects be teacher designed Kr student designed? I believe summer projects should be teacher designed. Teacher designed projects are entirely beneficial than student designed projects because students prepare themselves for college, it takes them less time TK complete the project and help students develop many Other skills needed in life.First, students are able TK prepare for college with a teacher designed project, by helping them get used TK a criterion that comes with a project. Often time in college students are given certain requirements needed TK get a passing score. For example, a student may have TK write a 10 page report in MLA format when they attend college if they are not used TK completing strict projects, they may not complete the courses needed in college. That is why it is imperative if students start new than TK be left behind later.Second, summer projects should be straight TK the point and shouldnt last an extended amount Kph time TK complete.If students hit the basic points and Objectives Kph a project than they will learn more about the specific subject, and they will excel passed the standard qualifications Kph the project. If there is less time wasted Kn guessing what the teacher would like TK see, than that gives students more time TK enjoy their summer.Lastly, teacher designed projects may help students excel in life. Teacher designed projects are developed TK encourage students in many ways. For example, if the teacher assigns a report; that will help a student with word documents. Also, if a teacher assigns a speech as a project it will help students with their public speaking. Teachers help prepare students for their future and everything they will need in life.In conclusion, teacher designed projects help students in many ways possible. They will be able TK experience a taste Kph college, take less time with their project and help students in the long run. Some may say that summer projects should be student based TK encourage their minds Kph creativity and uniqueness, however without the guidance from a teacher students may not understand the importance Kph structured classwork. Schools should allow summer projects TK be teacher designed TK help students reach their full potential.
