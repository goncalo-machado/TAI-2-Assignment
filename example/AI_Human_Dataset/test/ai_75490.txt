 Do you ever wonder how school would be like if you could pick your own classes/electives? I believe that students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. There are many reasons why I think this. Students are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do. Counselors or teachers should not be picking students or electives. Students want to be taking or doing many things that they are into to. I think that music, drama, or an art class should be electives.Students are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do because they want to do what interests them. For example, I do not like to take music, it bores me. I would rather take drama. People are very different from each other. Such as music, drama, and art should be extra credit for students that are interested in thiose kind of electives/classes. We just need to give students a chance to do their own things and be choosing their own kinds of thing.Counselors or teachers should not be picking students electives. The reason why I think this is because all electives should not be classes in general. For example, some people like math, instead of students taking an art class, ect. They can be taking another math class. If thats what they love learning about because with art, we cant do anything with it in the future. Which in math we mostly use it and need it in everything.Students want to be doing many things that they love in school. Yes, that is very true. CLASSES THAT ARE FOR FUN SHOULD BE ELECTIVES!! Not required. We should just think about what we like to do best. Everyone should be able to pick their own classes.In conclusion, music, drama, and art should not be required. Student like to do what they like best. Counselors/teachers should be picking those classes for us.
