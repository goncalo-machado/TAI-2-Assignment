 I think I agree with the idea of having one and a half hours in class because it would allow for more time to learn and study. The longer electives would also provide a better learning experience and reduce stress levels. With more time for electives, students would play games or engage in other activities they enjoy, which would make the learning experience more enjoyable.Additionally, having one and a half hours in class would give students more time to focus on their studies and improve their grades. This would make them better students in all classes, not just electives. Improved grades would also make students more attractive to colleges and employers, which would increase their changes of success in the future.Furthermore, having one and a half hours in class would make parents proud of their childrens achievements. Better grades would also mean that parents would be more likely to buy their children gifts and other rewards. This would be a great motivator for students to continue working hard in school.In conclusion, having one and a half hours in class would be beneficial for students in many ways. It would provide more time to learn and study, reduce stress levels, improve grades, and make parents proud. With these benefits, I believe that having one and a half hours in class would be a great addition to the school system.
