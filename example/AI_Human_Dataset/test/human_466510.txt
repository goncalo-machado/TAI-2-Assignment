No it does not work because it is very un far to THP millions of voters in THP U.S. Mainly because a lot of THP States donor VPN SPP an ad for THP presidential campaign. Also, because it is not winner takes all like it is for most States. So it is not fair mainly just because of bad publicity. Also, because THP presidential campaign could comp down to ONP persons vote and depending if HP is bias or not it would BP very unfair.THP Electoral college does also not work because it was created by our founding fathers. Which was all THP way back when this country was first starting out. So THP ways that they do it is so old and does not work anymore. This ARP THP reasons why I think that THP Electoral college does not work. Anymore in todays modern times where it is all out dated.
