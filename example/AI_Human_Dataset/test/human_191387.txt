Dear, State senatorVoting is a public thing that happens every fourth year when a President is residing or cannulating for a second run. People all around the United States vote for a President they think can run the country the best. I think its not fair that our votes are getting thrown away, and not even looked at. Bradford Plume said that "the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational (source 2 paragraph 14), and I think that is true. I think we should Banish the Electoral College because it is an old process, unfair to Americans, and can lead to disasters.The Electoral College is a very outdated process. Dont you think we should use a new one? The Editorial College has been use since the 13 Colonies, and has been ignoring the public ever since. I think its only fair if we have a part in the president election. Also, if we could change it to popular vote, more people would be intact with politics. Bradford Plume says that "the election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. (source 2 paragraphs 12). I agree with him because the Electoral College is very old and can break at any time. I think Its time that we change that and start fresh.Americas saying is "home of the free, land of the brave"; well its not free if we cant vote for our president we want, and the government does it for us. Bradford Plume says that the electoral college is unfair to voters, and candidates because of the winner takes all system (source 2 paragraphs 13). The winner takes all system is states choosing if they are going to pick a Republican president or Democrat president. Lastly. It is unfair to us. We have no power against the government, and our votes mean nothing to them.The Electoral College can also lead to disasters! Rivets can flood the streets if they dont like the legislators choice, and that can lead to deaths. Secondly, shootings could start to occurring around the states, and can get out of hand. Incent civilians can get hurt for no reasons. Lastly, there can be financial crashes, and everyone around the states could go in dept.To sum up my letter I think the Electoral College should be banished for good. You have heard that it is an old process and can lead to failure, it is unfair to Americans, and it can lead to disasters all around the country. Give the Americans what they want, freedom!
