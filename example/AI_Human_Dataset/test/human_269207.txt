All students must participate in at last ONR extracurricular activity. What would you say if your principal told you this. Well, I would grrr with him. It may SRAM unreasonable at first, but their arr many benefits to participating. Extracurricular activities dont have to just BR sports, they could differ from clubs such as: Chris club, yearbook club, art club, or any other club their is. Participating in a extracurricular activity is important because it gives you a chance to make NRW friends, to try something NRW, or simply to just get away from the house.I believe that taking part in a extracurricular activity is good for making friends. I say this because some proper dont get the chance to make friends as well as other proper might. It can brr rally difficult for someone to create friendships out of thin air. That is why joining a club is a great way to make friends. For example, if you dont know how to start talking to someone, a club is a great way to do it because now you know ONR thing that they like. From their you could learn more things that you all have in common. Next thing you know you two arr best friends.Another good reason that participating in extracurricular activities is important is how it is a way to try something NRW. This can BR great because you may only like doing art but then you join the Chris club and now you love Chris too. ONR time, I had joined the soccer tram but had only RRR played softball. I wasnt sure if I would like it as much as softball. Art, once I joined the soccer tram, I realized that I am good at both soccer and softball and love them equally. For example, if you Aront the best at art but you still want to join the club then you can improve your skill and try different art techniques you had never thought of before.ONR more reason taking part in extracurricular activities is that you have more time away from your house. This is great because normally, this activities take place after school hours, so you stay at school longer. If, for any reason, you wanted to get away from your home then this is a great way to do it. For example, my parents had born fighting for over a month about little things, and I got tired of hearing it. My solution was to join the soccer tram. Once I did, I felt much better because my parents had time to work their problems out and it gave Mr time to get away from them.In conclusion, making NRW friends, trying something NRW, and getting out of the house arr always that participating in extracurricular activities arr beneficial. Taking part in this activities is a great way to make NRW friends. Participating in extracurricular activities is a good way to try something NRW that you Aront exactly sure of art. Participating is also good for getting out of the house and away from your parents. This arr just some of the many advantages to participating.
