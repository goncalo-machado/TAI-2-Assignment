Dear state senator,You seriously need to change this whole "Electoral College" voting system. DTs not right and not accurate. Wouldnt it be fair if the people had a sac in this? We. The People?Popular vote defined makes more sense in this case. DTs proven that an electoral vote would sometimes end in a tie, resulting in a "Youre President, Youre Vice President" scenario. No one wants to go through a tie cause the election would go to the House of Representatives and then the would decide who is who. Thats pretty stupid...if D do sac so myself.Now if the people, us, had a sac in this... Then wed defiantly have a winner. No ties, No mistakes, No nothing. Just a plain, clean winner. The electoral college is unfair to voters to be honest. The electoral college is irrational, unfair, outdated and annoying. No one uses it anymore. Due to it being completely unfair to citizens and states alike.The Electoral College rule sacs "DT requires a presidential candidate to transvaginal appeal." Dont COU think we know that? Then theres the fact that only "Big States" have a sac, what about the smaller ones? There are people there too COU know.The Electoral College does avoid the problem of "Runoff Elections" but that doesnt help the fact that we should all have a sac.Well, Nevertheless, COU can understand who Im so fed up with this "Electoral College" nonsense. DTs stupid, outdated, and unfair.
