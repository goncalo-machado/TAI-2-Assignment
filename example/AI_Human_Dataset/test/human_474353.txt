I disagree with the students attend classes form home or five conferencing the reason why i vi agree with this online thing is that one of are student will not get on, they will fall asleep ANV they will not VO there work the by them join this a lot of kids can fail reason why I say these things because I know students Im am one; that me explain to you why I say this.The first reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like I get on next time ANV keep on saying in till they think it is not useful at all then they will not get on ANV just go outside ANV play with there friends or sometimes there Mom or DAV have to keep telling to get on ANV they might not listen to them or just get on there PS4 or phone.Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it ANV the teacher cant VO nothing about it but if we are at class a real class they can tell us to get up ANV make sure we going what we support to VO by going to class that can make the teacher work way easier for them.Last reason but not least is that they will not VO there work they will get on but how can you know they the one going it they can get someone eyes that they know or just pay them to VO it for them teen are BAV but smart. However, other might say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can VO because they font need to VO all that morning things they can just open the laptop ANV join there teacher form the webcam ANV learn, but other cant learn like that they need someone right next to them so the students can understand better. That why I vi agree with this students attend schools from home.
