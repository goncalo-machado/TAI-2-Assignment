Scientist Albert Einstein said," Imagination is more important than knowledge." I really agree with him. Imagination can make yourself happier, can help people, it also can find a nice job that you want. What are these things mean? Let me tell you in this essay.First, imagination can make yourself happier. Why? It is because you can imagine something that you like. For example, you want to fly like a bird but you cant do that. You can imagine how that feel. It feels free? Comfortable? Or tired? You can also imagine how you look like when you were 100 years old. Imagination make yourself happy.Second, how can imagination help people? Lets think about if there is a child crying in the mall and everyone look at her because she dress so weird. You can use your imagination at this moment. You may told her to imagine with you. For example,"Dont crying sweetie, think about everyone look at you is because you dress like a princess. Now you are visiting them. You have to be nice and elegant. " Maybe she will stop crying.Lastly,parents always said " You cant find a nice job that you want by having your imagination." I think you can find a job with your imagination. For example, if you want to be a home designer but you dont have imagination. You make the house so horrible. You will got fired and you cant earn money. On the other hand, if you want to be writer and you can imagine lots of things and create 30 or more excellent books. You can earn lot of money even earn more that a doctor. So, I think Imagination can find a really nice job that you want.To sum up, I totally agree with Scientist Albert Einstein. " Imagination is more important than knowledge. Imagination can make yourself happier, can help people, or find a nice job that you want. I think it imagination is the most important thing in the world!
